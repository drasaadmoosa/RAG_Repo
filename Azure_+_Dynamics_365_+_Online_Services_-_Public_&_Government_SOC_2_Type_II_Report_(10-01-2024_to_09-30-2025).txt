Scope 
We have examined the description of the Azure 1 system of management of Microsoft Corporation (the “Service 
Organization” or “Microsoft”) included in section 3, “Management of Microsoft’s Description of its Azure System” 
throughout the period October 1, 2024 to September 30, 2025 2 (the “Description”) based on the criteria for a 
Description of a service organization’s system in DC Section 200, 2018 Description Criteria for a Description of a 
Service Organization’s System in a SOC 2® Report, in AICPA Description Criteria, (“description criteria”), and the 
suitability of the design and, operating effectiveness of controls stated in the Description throughout the period 
October 1, 2024 to September 30, 2025, to provide reasonable assurance that Microsoft’s service commitments 
and system requirements would be achieved based on the trust services criteria relevant to security, availability, 
processing integrity, and confidentiality (“applicable trust services criteria”) 3 set forth in TSP Section 100, 2017 Trust 
Services Criteria for Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy, in AICPA Trust Services 
Criteria. 
The information in section 5, “Other Information Provided by Management of Microsoft” is presented by 
management of Microsoft to provide additional information and is not a part of management of Microsoft’s 
Description of its Azure system made available to user entities during the period October 1, 2024 to September 30, 
2025. Content on the webpages directed by all the links in Sections 3 and 5 and information in section 5 have not 
been subjected to the procedures applied in the examination of the Description of the Azure system and of the 
suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of controls to achieve Microsoft’s service commitments and 
system requirements based on the applicable trust services criteria and, accordingly we express no opinion on it. 
Service Organization’s Responsibilities 
Management of Microsoft is responsible for its service commitments and system requirements and for designing, 
implementing, and operating effective controls within the system to provide reasonable assurance that Microsoft’s 
service commitments and system requirements would be achieved. Management of Microsoft has provided the 
accompanying assertion in section 2 titled “Management of Microsoft’s Assertion” (the “Assertion”) about the 
Description and the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of controls stated therein. Management of 
Microsoft is also responsible for preparing the Description and Assertion, including the completeness, accuracy, 
and method of presentation of the Description and Assertion; providing the services covered by the Description; 
selecting the applicable trust services criteria and stating the related controls in the Description; and identifying the 
risks that threaten the achievement of the service organization’s service commitments and system requirements.

Service Auditor’s Responsibilities  
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Description and on the suitability of design and operating 
effectiveness of controls stated in the Description based on our examination.  
Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of 
Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised), 
Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, issued by the 
International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). Those standards require that we plan and perform 
the examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether, in all material respects, the Description is 
presented in accordance with the description criteria, and the controls stated therein were suitably designed and 
operating effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the Microsoft’s service commitments and system 
requirements would be achieved based on the applicable trust services criteria. We believe that the evidence we 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
An examination of a Description of a service organization’s system and the suitability of the design and operating 
effectiveness of controls involves: 
• 
Obtaining an understanding of the system and the service organization’s service commitments and system 
requirements. 
• 
Assessing the risks that the Description is not presented in accordance with the description criteria and that 
controls were not suitably designed or did not operate effectively. 
• 
Performing procedures to obtain evidence about whether the Description is presented in accordance with the 
description criteria.  
• 
Performing procedures to obtain evidence about whether controls stated in the Description were suitably 
designed to provide reasonable assurance that the service organization would achieve its service commitments 
and system requirements based on the applicable trust services criteria. 
• 
Testing the operating effectiveness of those controls stated in the Description to provide reasonable assurance 
that Microsoft achieved its service commitments and system requirements based on the applicable trust 
services criteria. 
• 
Evaluating the overall presentation of the Description. 
Our examination also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the 
circumstances.  
Service Auditor’s Independence and Quality Control 
We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code of 
Professional Conduct established by the AICPA and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code 
of Ethics for Professional Accountants. We have complied with those requirements. We applied the Statements on 
Quality Control Standards established by the AICPA and the International Standards on Quality Management issued 
by the IAASB and, accordingly, maintain a comprehensive system of quality control. 
Inherent Limitations 
The Description is prepared to meet the common needs of a broad range of report users and therefore may not 
include every aspect of the system that each individual report user may consider important to meet their 
informational needs.  
There are inherent limitations in any system of internal control, including the possibility of human error and the 
circumvention of controls. 


--- Page 9 ---
 
6 
 
Because of their nature, controls may not always operate effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the 
Service Organization’s service commitments and system requirements are achieved based on the applicable trust 
services criteria. Also, the projection to the future of any conclusions about the suitability of the design and 
operating effectiveness of controls is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes 
in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
Description of Tests of Controls 
The specific controls tested, and the nature, timing, and results of those tests are listed in section 4, “Management 
of Microsoft’s Description of its Relevant Criteria and Related Controls, and Independent Service Auditor’s 
Description of Tests of Controls and Results.” 
Opinion  
In our opinion, in all material respects:  
a. The Description presents Microsoft’s Azure system that was designed and implemented throughout the period 
October 1, 2024 to September 30, 2025, in accordance with the description criteria. 
b. The controls stated in the Description were suitably designed throughout the period October 1, 2024 to 
September 30, 2025, to provide reasonable assurance that Microsoft’s service commitments and system 
requirements would be achieved based on the applicable trust services criteria, if its controls operated 
effectively throughout that period. 
c. The controls stated in the Description operated effectively throughout the period October 1, 2024 to September 
30, 2025, to provide reasonable assurance that Microsoft’s service commitments and system requirements 
would be achieved based on the applicable trust services criteria. 
Restricted Use 
This report, including the description of tests of controls and results thereof in section 4, is intended solely for the 
information and use of management of Microsoft, user entities of Microsoft’s Azure system during some or all of the 
period October 1, 2024 to September 30, 2025, business partners of Microsoft subject to risks arising from 
interactions with Microsoft’s system, practitioners providing services to such user entities and business partners, 
prospective user entities and business partners, and regulators who have sufficient knowledge and understanding 
of the following:

Section 3: Management of Microsoft’s Description of its 
Azure System 
Overview of Operations 
Business Description  
Azure 
Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform for building, deploying and managing applications through a global 
network of Microsoft and third-party managed datacenters. It supports both Platform as a Service (PaaS) and 
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud service models and enables hybrid solutions that integrate cloud services 
with customers’ on-premises resources. Microsoft Azure supports many customers, partners, and government 
organizations that span across a broad range of products and services, geographies, and industries. Microsoft Azure 
is designed to meet their security, confidentiality, and compliance requirements. 
Microsoft datacenters support Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Dynamics 365, and Microsoft Online Services (“Online 
Services”). Online Services such as Intune, Power BI, and others are Software as a Service (SaaS) services that 
leverage the underlying Microsoft Azure platform and datacenter infrastructure. See section titled ‘Azure and Azure 
Government Report Scope and Boundary’ for the Microsoft Azure services and offerings and Online Services that are 
in scope for this report. 
Dynamics 365 
Dynamics 365 is an online business application suite that integrates the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) 
capabilities and its extensions with the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) capabilities. These end-to-end business 
applications help customers turn relationships into revenue, earn customers, and accelerate business growth. 
“Azure”, when referenced in this report, comprises of “Microsoft Azure”, “Microsoft Dynamics 365”, “Online 
Services”, and the supporting datacenters listed in this report.

In addition to datacenter, network, and personnel security practices, Azure also incorporates security practices at 
the application and platform layers to enhance security for application development and service administration. 
Principal Service Commitments and System Requirements 
Microsoft makes service commitments to its customers, business partners and vendors, and has established 
system requirements as part of the Azure service. Some of these commitments are principal to the performance of 
the service and relate to applicable trust services criteria. Microsoft is responsible for its service commitments and 
system requirements and for designing, implementing, and operating effective controls within the system to provide 
reasonable assurance that Microsoft’s service commitments and system requirements are achieved. 
Service commitments to customers are documented and communicated in the Microsoft Online Subscription 
Agreement, Product Terms, Microsoft Azure Privacy Statement, and Microsoft Trust Center, as well as in the 
description of the service offering provided online. Service commitments include, but are not limited to, the 
following: 
• 
Security: Microsoft has made commitments related to securing customer data and complying with relevant 
laws and regulations. These commitments are addressed through measures including data encryption, 
authentication mechanisms, physical security and other relevant security controls. 
• 
Availability: Microsoft has made commitments related to percentage uptime and connectivity for Azure as well 
as commitments related to service credits for instances of downtime. 
• 
Processing Integrity: Microsoft has made commitments related to processing customer actions completely, 
accurately and timely. These customer actions include, for example, specifying geographic regions for the 
storage and processing of customer data. 
• 
Confidentiality: Microsoft has made commitments related to maintaining the confidentiality of customers’ data 
through data classification policies, data encryption and other relevant security controls.  
Microsoft has established operational requirements that support the achievement of service commitments, 
relevant laws and regulations, and other system requirements. Such requirements including the following: 
• 
Information security policies define an organization-wide approach to how systems and data are protected. 
These include policies around how the service is designed and developed, how the system is operated, how the 
internal business systems and networks are managed and how employees are hired and trained.  
• 
In addition to these policies, standard operating procedures are documented on how to carry out specific 
manual and automated processes required in the operation and development of various Azure services and 
offerings. 
• 
Procedures are in place so that the access, collection, use, and deletion of customer data is in accordance with 
the service commitments. 
• 
Cryptographic controls are implemented to protect customer data. Access to cryptographic keys is restricted to 
only authorized personnel. 
• 
Policies and instructions for controlling and monitoring third parties (e.g. service providers or suppliers) whose 
services contribute to the provision of the cloud service are documented and communicated. 
• 
Azure services are designed to maintain high availability through redundancy and automatic failover to minimize 
disruption to services. 
• 
Critical systems are monitored through third-party and internal tools to maintain availability. 
• 
Access to physical and logical assets is limited to authorized users and is provisioned based on job 
requirements to mitigate risk of unauthorized access. 


--- Page 27 ---
 
24 
 
• 
Automated logging and alerting capabilities are implemented for Azure services to detect potential 
unauthorized activity and security events. 
• 
Incidents impacting internal and customer systems are detected, escalated and resolved. 
• 
Development of new features and major changes to Azure services are performed in accordance with policies 
and procedures. 
• 
Azure offerings and services are configured be interoperable with industry standards. 
Such requirements are communicated in Azure’s system policies and procedures, system design documentation, 
and contracts with customers. Microsoft’s service commitments and system requirements are designed based on 
the trust services criteria relevant to security, availability, processing integrity, and confidentiality, and other 
frameworks. 
Control Environment 
Integrity and Ethical Values 
Corporate governance at Microsoft starts with an independent Board of Directors that establishes, maintains, and 
monitors standards and policies for ethics, business practices, and compliance that span across the company. 
Corporate governance at Microsoft serves several purposes:  
1. To establish and preserve management accountability to Microsoft’s owners by appropriately distributing rights 
and responsibilities among Microsoft Board members, managers, and shareholders  
2. To provide a structure through which management and the Board set and attain objectives and monitor 
performance 
3. To strengthen and safeguard a culture of business integrity and responsible business practices 
4. To encourage efficient use of resources and to require accountability for stewardship of these resources 
Further information about Microsoft’s general corporate governance is available on the Microsoft public website. 
Microsoft Standards of Business Conduct 
The Microsoft Standards of Business Conduct (SBC) reflect a commitment to ethical business practices and 
regulatory compliance. They summarize the principles and policies that guide Microsoft’s business activities and 
provide information about Microsoft’s Business Conduct and Compliance Program. SBC was developed in full 
consideration of Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) and proposed NASDAQ listing requirements related to codes of conduct. 
Additional information about Microsoft’s SBC is available on the Microsoft public website. 
Training 
Annual SBC training is mandatory for all Microsoft employees and contingent staff. The SBC training includes 
information about Microsoft corporate policies for conducting business while conforming to applicable laws and 
regulations. It reinforces the need for employees to work with integrity and to comply with the laws of the countries 
in which Microsoft operates. It also guides employees and contingent staff on the processes and channels available 
to report possible violations or to ask questions. Microsoft also trains its outsourced providers to understand and 
comply with Microsoft’s supplier code of conduct. 
Accountability  
All Microsoft and contingent staff are accountable for understanding and adhering to the guidance contained in the 
Microsoft Security Policy, and any applicable supporting procedures. Individuals not employed by Microsoft, but 
allowed to access, manage, or process information assets of the Azure environment and datacenters are also 
accountable for understanding and adhering to the guidance contained in the Security Policy and standards.

Commitment to Competence 
Microsoft hiring managers define job requirements prior to recruiting, interviewing, and hiring. Job requirements 
include the primary responsibilities and tasks involved in the job, background skills needed to perform the job, and 
personal qualifications desired. Once the requirements are determined, managers create a job description, which is 
a profile of the job, and is used to identify potential candidates. When viable candidates are identified, the interview 
process begins to evaluate candidates and make an appropriate hiring decision. 
Microsoft employees create individual Core Priorities that align with those of their manager, organization, and 
Microsoft, and are supported with customer-centric actions and measures so that everyone is working toward the 
same overarching vision. These Core Priorities are established when an employee is hired, and then updated during 
one-on-one Connect meetings with their manager. The primary focus of the Connect meetings is to assess 
employee performance against their priorities and to agree on an updated list of priorities going forward. 
Microsoft’s Compensation Committee is responsible for reviewing and discussing plans for executive officer 
development and corporate succession plans for the CEO and other executive officers. 
Internal Communication  
Responsibilities around internal controls are communicated broadly through Monthly Controller calls, All Hands 
Meetings run by the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and email updates sent / conference calls held by the Financial 
Compliance Group with the Sarbanes-Oxley extended project team. Responsibilities for compliance with policies 
are outlined in the SBC training.  
Compliance & Ethics - Board of Directors and Senior Leadership  
Compliance & Ethics designs and provides reports to the Board of Directors on compliance matters. They also 
organize annual meetings with the Senior Leadership Team (SLT) for their compliance review.  
Internal Audit Department 
Microsoft has an Internal Audit (IA) function that reports directly to the Audit Committee (AC) of the Board of 
Directors, which is constituted solely of independent directors. IA has a formal charter that is reviewed by the AC 
and management. Responsibilities of IA include performing audits and reporting issues and recommendations to 
management and the AC. 
Audit Committee  
The AC charter and responsibilities are on Microsoft’s website. The AC meets privately on a quarterly basis with 
Microsoft’s external auditors and IA. The agendas for the quarterly AC meetings are found in the AC Responsibilities 
Calendar sent out with the charter. In addition, the AC influences the company through the IA function. The AC 
reviews the scope of internal audit and assists in the process of identifying and resolving any issues. Lastly, the AC 
monitors itself by completing an annual self-evaluation. 
Risk Assessment 
Practices for Identification of Risk  
The Microsoft Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) team provides management and accountability of Microsoft 
Corporate’s short- and long-term risks. ERM collaborates with Internal Audit, the Financial Compliance Group, 
Operations, and Legal and Compliance groups to perform a formal risk assessment. These risk assessments 
include risks in financial reporting, fraud, and compliance with laws. 
Internal Audit - Fraud Risks  
IA and the Financial Integrity Unit (FIU) are responsible for identifying fraud risks across Microsoft. The FIU performs 
procedures for the detection, investigation, and prevention of financial fraud impacting Microsoft worldwide. Fraud 
and abuse that are uncovered are reported to the Disclosure Committee. The FIU provides both a reactive and 


--- Page 29 ---
 
26 
 
proactive response to allegations of fraud and abuse. The FIU uses a case management system that is also used by 
the Director of Compliance to track cases and related metrics. The FIU interacts with Microsoft management, 
Corporate, External, and Legal Affairs (CELA), Human Resource (HR), Finance, Procurement, and others to 
determine specific fraud risks and responses.  
Periodic Risk Assessment  
IA and other groups within the company perform a periodic risk assessment. The assessment is reviewed by senior 
management.  
IA specialization area leaders determine high-priority risks across the company, including risks related to financial 
reporting, operational business process, and systems controls. Control failures are also assessed to determine 
whether they give rise to additional risks. 
Compliance & Ethics / Internal Audit / Risk Management - Risk Responsibility  
The responsibility for risk is distributed throughout the organization based on the individual group’s services. 
Compliance & Ethics, IA, and the ERM team work together to represent enterprise risk management. Through 
quarter and year-end reviews, the CFO, and Corporate Controller (and respective groups) review the disclosures 
and issues that may have arisen. 
Monitoring 
Security and Compliance Monitoring 
Azure and the datacenters maintain reasonable and appropriate technical and organizational measures, internal 
controls, and information security routines intended to help protect customer data against accidental loss, 
destruction, or alteration; unauthorized disclosure or access; or unlawful destruction.  
Compliance & Ethics - Business Conduct Hotline  
There is a confidential and anonymous Business Conduct Hotline available for employees to report issues. The 
hotline is accessible 24x7 through email, phone, fax, and mail. The individual may also send a letter or fax reporting 
the concern to Microsoft’s Compliance & Ethics - Business & Regulatory Investigations team. 
Employees are instructed that it is their duty to promptly report any concerns of suspected or known violations of 
the Code of Professional Conduct, the SBC, or other Microsoft policies or guidelines. The procedures to be followed 
for such a report are outlined in the SBC and the Whistle Blowing Reporting Procedure and Guidelines in the 
Employee Handbook. Employees are also encouraged to communicate the issue to their manager, their manager’s 
manager, their CELA contact, their HR contact, or the Compliance Office.  
Internal Audit  
Microsoft’s IA department provides support to management across the company by independently and objectively 
assessing whether the objectives of management are adequately performed, and by facilitating process 
improvements, and the adoption of business practices, policies, and controls governing worldwide operations. 
Information and Communication 
An annual process exists to set objectives and commitments among all executives and is rolled down to employees. 
These commitments and objectives are filtered down to team members through the annual and midyear review 
process. 
Office of the CFO - Communications External to the Company 
CFO communications outside the company occur throughout the year and, where appropriate, these external 
communications include a discussion of the company’s attitude toward sound internal controls. The Office of the

27 
 
CFO is responsible for a number of communications outside the company, including Quarterly Earnings Release, 
Financial Analyst meetings, customer visits, external conferences, and external publications. 
Data 
Customers upload data for storage or processing within the services or applications that are hosted on the cloud 
services platform. In addition, certain types of data are provided by the customers or generated on the customer’s 
behalf to enable the usage of the cloud services. Microsoft only uses customer data in order to support the 
provisioning of the services subscribed to by the customers in accordance with the Service Level Agreements 
(SLAs). The customer provided data are broadly classified into the following data types: 
1. Access Control Data is data used to manage access to administrative roles or sensitive functions. 
2. Customer Content is the data, information and code that Microsoft internal employees, and non-Microsoft 
personnel (if present) provide to, transfer in, store in or process in a Microsoft Online Service or product. 
3. End User Identifiable Information (EUII) is data that directly identifies or could be used to identify the 
authenticated user of a Microsoft service. EUII does not extend to other personal information found in Customer 
Content. 
4. Support Data is data provided to Microsoft and generated by Microsoft as part of support activities. 
5. Feedback is data provided as part of a review or feedback for one of Microsoft’s products and services that 
includes personal data. 
6. Account Data is information about payment instruments. This type of data is not stored in the Azure platform.  
7. Public Personal Data is publicly available personal information that Microsoft obtains from external sources. 
8. End User Pseudonymous Identifiers (EUPI) are identifiers created by Microsoft, tied to the user of a Microsoft 
service.  
9. Managed Service Data is all data provided to Microsoft by the Managed Service customer and / or the Managed 
Service personnel as part of a Managed Service engagement. 
10. Organization Identifiable Information (OII) is data that can be used to identify a particular tenant / Azure 
subscription / deployment / organization (generally configuration or usage data) and is not linkable to a user. 
11. System Metadata is data generated in the course of running the service, not linkable to a user or tenant. It does 
not contain Access Control Data, Customer Content, EUII, Support Data, Account Data, Public Personal Data, 
EUPI, or OII. 
12. Public Non-Personal Data is publicly available information that Microsoft obtains from external sources. It 
does not contain Public Personal Data. 
Data Ownership 
Microsoft does not inspect, approve, or monitor applications that customers deploy to Azure. Moreover, Microsoft 
does not know what kind of data customers choose to store in Azure. Microsoft does not claim data ownership over 
the customer information entered into Azure. Azure’s Agreement states, “Customers are solely responsible for the 
content of all Customer Data. Customers will secure and maintain all rights in Customer Data necessary for Azure 
to provide the Online Services to them without violating the rights of any third party or otherwise obligating Microsoft 
to them or to any third party. Microsoft does not and will not assume any obligations with respect to Customer Data 
or to their use of the Product other than as expressly set forth in the Agreement or as required by applicable law.” 
Applicable Data Elements 
For the purposes of this report, Microsoft has implemented controls to protect the data elements specifically 
covered under Customer Content and Access Control Data.

Azure Environment 
Azure is developed and managed by the Azure team, and provides a cloud platform based on machine virtualization. 
This means that customer code - whether it’s deployed in a PaaS Worker Role or an IaaS Virtual Machine - executes 
in a Windows Server Hyper-V virtual machine. Every physical node in Azure has one or more virtual machines, also 
called instances, that are scheduled on physical CPU cores, are assigned dedicated RAM, and have controlled 
access to local disk and network I/O. 
On each Azure node, there is a Hypervisor that runs directly over the hardware and divides a node into a variable 
number of Guest Virtual Machines (VMs). Each node also has one special Root VM, which runs the Host Operating 
System (OS), as shown in figure below. Fabric Agents (FAs) on Root VMs are used to manage Guest Agents (GAs) 
within Guest VMs. Isolation of the Root VM from the Guest VMs and the Guest VMs from one another is a key 
concept in Azure security architecture. 
 


--- Page 33 ---
 
30 
 
 
Fabric Controller Lifecycle Management 
In Azure, VMs (nodes) run on groups of physical servers known as “clusters”, of approximately 1,000 machines. 
Each cluster is independently managed by a scaled-out and redundant platform Fabric Controller (FC) software 
component. 
Each FC manages the lifecycle of VMs and applications running in its cluster, including provisioning and monitoring 
the health of the hardware under its control. The FC executes both automatic operations, like healing VM instances 
to healthy servers when it determines that the original server has failed, as well as application-management 
operations like deploying, updating, reimaging and scaling out applications. Dividing the datacenter into clusters 
isolates faults at the FC level, preventing certain classes of errors from affecting servers beyond the cluster in which 
they occur. FCs that serve a particular Azure cluster are grouped into FC Clusters. 
FC Managed Operating Systems 
An Azure OS base image Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) is deployed on all Host, Native, and Guest VMs in the Azure 
production environment. The three types of FC managed OS images are: 
1. Host OS: Host OS is a customized version of the Windows OS that runs on Host Machine Root VMs 
2. Native OS: Native OS runs on Azure native tenants such as the FC itself, Azure Storage and Load Balancer that 
do not have any hypervisor 
3. Guest OS: Guest OS runs on Guest VMs (for IaaS, FC will run customer provided images on a VHD) 
The Host OS and Native OS are OS images that run on physical servers and native tenants and host the Fabric Agent 
and other Host components. The Guest OS provides the most up-to-date runtime environment for Azure customers 
and can be automatically upgraded with new OS releases or manually upgraded based on customer preference. 
Software Development Kits 
Azure allows customers to create applications in many development languages. Microsoft provides language-
specific Software Development Kits (SDKs) for .NET, Java, PHP, Ruby, Node.js and others. In addition, there is a 
general Azure SDK that provides basic support for any language, such as C++ or Python. These SDKs can be used 
with development tools such as Visual Studio and Eclipse. 
These SDKs also support creating applications running outside the cloud that use Azure services. For example, a 
customer can build an application running on a Host that relies on Azure Blob Storage, or create a tool that 
automatically deploys Azure applications through the platform’s management interface.

Microsoft Security Policy 
Microsoft Security Policy outlines the high-level objectives related to information security, defines risk management 
requirements and information security roles and responsibilities. The Security Policy contains rules and 
requirements that are met by Azure and other Online Services staff in the delivery and operations of the Online 
Services environment. The Security Policy and Objectives are derived from the ISO / IEC 27001:2022 standard and is 
augmented to address relevant regulatory and industry requirements for the Online Services environment.  
The policy is reviewed and updated, as necessary, at least annually, or more frequently, in case of a significant 
security event, or upon significant changes to the service or business model, legal requirements, organization or 
platform.  
Each management-endorsed version of the Microsoft Security Policy and all subsequent updates are distributed to 
all relevant stakeholders from the Microsoft intranet site. 
Roles and Responsibilities 
Information security roles and responsibilities have been defined across the different Azure functions. The Cloud + 
AI Security team facilitates implementation of security controls and provides security guidance to the teams. The 
Global Ecosystem and Compliance team also coordinates with representatives from CELA (including leads of IT and 
Security), Human Resources (personnel security), and Microsoft Online Services (security policy requirements) on 
additional information security related activities impacting the services.  
Personnel  
Microsoft performs employee background screening as determined by the hiring manager based on access to 
sensitive data, including access to personally identifiable information or to back-end computing assets and per 
customer requirements, as applicable. Microsoft also employs a formal performance review process to ensure 
employees adequately meet the responsibilities of their position, including adherence to company policies, 
information security policies, and workplace rules. Hiring managers may, at their discretion, initiate corrective 
actions, up to and including immediate termination, if any aspect of an employee’s performance and conduct is not 
satisfactory.  
The Microsoft Online Services Delivery Platform Group works with Microsoft Human Resources and vendor 
companies to perform the required background check on each new or transferred personnel before they are granted 
access to the Microsoft Online Services production assets containing customer data.  
Corporate policies are communicated to employees and relevant external parties during the onboarding process 
and as part of the annual security training and awareness education program. Non-disclosure Agreements (NDAs) 
are signed by employees and relevant external parties upon engagement with Microsoft. Disciplinary actions are 
defined for personnel who violate the Microsoft Security Policy or commit a security breach. Employees are also 
required to comply with relevant laws, regulations and provisions regarding information security remain valid if the 
area of responsibility changes or the employment relationship is terminated. Security Policy and non-disclosure 
requirements are reviewed periodically to validate appropriate protection of information. 
Training and Awareness  
Information security training and awareness is provided to Azure employees, contractors, datacenter personnel, 
and third parties on an ongoing basis to educate them on applicable policies, standards and information security 
practices. Awareness training on security, availability and confidentiality of information is provided to employees at 
the time of joining as part of induction. In addition, all staff participate in a mandatory security, compliance, and 
privacy training periodically in order to design, build and operate secure cloud services. 
Employees receive information security training and awareness through different programs such as new employee 
orientation, computer-based training, and periodic communication (e.g., compliance program updates). These 
include training and awareness pertaining to the platform, in the security, availability, confidentiality, and integrity 


--- Page 68 ---
 
65 
 
domains. In addition, job-specific training is provided to personnel, where appropriate. The key objectives of the 
information security training and awareness program are listed below: 
Objective 1 
The learner will be able to articulate the need to protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the 
production environment. 
Objective 2 
The learner will be able to apply basic security practices to safeguard and handle the production 
environment and customer information. 
Objective 3 
The learner will understand the criticality of security, compliance and privacy in relation to customer 
expectations. 
Objective 4 
The learner will have a basic understanding of the responsibility to meet compliance and privacy 
commitments. 
Objective 5 
The learner will know where to find additional information on security, privacy, business continuity / 
disaster recovery and compliance. 
All Engineering staff are required to complete a computer-based training module when they join the team. Staff are 
required to retake this training at least once per fiscal year. 
In addition, annual SBC training is mandatory for all Microsoft employees. The SBC training includes an anti-
corruption section that focuses on Microsoft’s anti-corruption policies and highlights policies that reinforce the 
need for employees to work with integrity and to comply with the anti-corruption laws of the countries in which 
Microsoft operates. All active employees are required to complete this course. 
Information System Review 
Azure performs a periodic Information Security Management System (ISMS) review and results are reviewed with the 
management. ISMS documents cover scope, declaration of applicability and the results of the last management 
review. This involves monitoring ongoing effectiveness and improvement of the ISMS control environment by 
reviewing security issues, audit results, and monitoring status, and by planning and tracking necessary corrective 
actions.  
Compliance Requirements 
Azure maintains reasonable and appropriate technical and organizational measures, internal controls, and 
information security routines intended to help protect customer data against accidental loss, destruction, or 
alteration; unauthorized disclosure or access; or unlawful destruction. 
Azure compliance requirements are monitored and reviewed regularly with CELA and other internal organizations, 
as applicable. Members of the Global Ecosystem and Compliance, and Cloud + AI Security teams update relevant 
SOPs, Security Policy and service descriptions in order to remain in-line with compliance requirements. 
The Security Policy requires a periodic review of the performance of policies and procedures governing information 
security. The Global Ecosystem and Compliance team coordinates independent third party audits (internal and 
external) which evaluate systems and control owners for compliance with security policies, standards, and other 
requirements. Audit activities are planned and agreed upon in advance by stakeholders, including approval for 
necessary read access required to perform such audits to avoid impacting the overall availability of the service. 
External independent audits are performed at least annually and any findings are prioritized and tracked to 
resolution. 
Risk Management 
Azure has developed and documented a risk assessment policy to address the purpose, scope, roles, and 
responsibilities for managing deviations from the security policies/standards. The risk assessment policy and 
procedures are reviewed and updated on an annual basis. 


--- Page 69 ---
 
66 
 
Azure performs a cryptography risk assessment for encryption and key management to evaluate changes and updates to 
cryptography controls. Security risks related to external parties (such as customers, contractors and vendors) are 
identified and addressed within the Azure environment based on Microsoft’s corporate procurement process. 
Designated responsibilities are defined to coordinate with relevant corporate groups (e.g., CELA, Procurement) in 
reviewing risks associated with external parties and establishing relevant agreements. Prior to contracting with 
Microsoft, suppliers undergo a risk assessment based on the services that will be provided and data handled.  
Operator Access 
Production Infrastructure Access Management 
Identity and Access Management (Microsoft Personnel)  
The Security Policy establishes the access control requirements for requesting and provisioning user access for 
accounts and services. The policy requires that access be denied by default, follow least privilege principle, and be 
granted only upon business need.  
Azure uses a specific corporate Active Directory (AD) infrastructure for centralized authentication and authorization 
to restrict access to the systems and services within the Azure environment. Each user account is unique and is 
identifiable to an individual user. 
Domain-account management requests are routed to the designated asset owner or associated agent according to 
established account provisioning and de-provisioning processes for approval. Typically, access is controlled 
through addition of individual user accounts to established domain security groups within the AD. Access requests 
to domain security groups require explicit approval from the assigned security group owner. Requests requiring 
explicit approval are automatically forwarded to the security group owner for approval in the system. In addition, 
Azure Government access requires explicit approval with required screening to confirm US citizenship of the user 
that is requesting access. 
Employee status data from Microsoft HR is used to facilitate the provisioning and removal of user accounts in Azure-
managed AD domains. Automated feeds from Microsoft HR systems provide this information, and account 
management processes prevent the creation of an account for individuals that do not have valid HR records. These 
feeds also initiate the removal of the user accounts for terminated users from the AD.  
Automated mechanisms have been implemented to manage the appropriateness of access granted to information 
systems. Manual periodic reviews of individual accounts and security group memberships on assets are performed 
by authorized individuals, as appropriate, to evaluate whether access is still required. Remediation action is taken, 
as necessary, based on the review.  
Policies and standards have been established and implemented to enforce appropriate user account password 
expiration, length, complexity, and history. Multi-factor authentication is enforced for production domains that do 
not require password-based authentication. Azure personnel are required to follow the Microsoft password policy 
for applicable domains as well as local user accounts for all assets. Additionally, domain user accounts, if inactive 
for more than 90 days, are suspended until the appropriateness of continued access for these accounts is resolved. 
If no action is taken by the user to reenable the suspended account, after 15 days the account is deleted.  
Access to Azure Components 
Access to the Azure components (e.g., Fabric, Storage, Subscriptions, and Network Devices) in the production 
environment is controlled through a designated set of access points and restricted to the corresponding service 
Production Support and Engineering teams. Access points such as Secure Admin Workstation (SAW) require users 
to perform two-factor authentication using a smart card and AD domain credentials to gain access. 
Access to network devices in the scope boundary requires two-factor authentication. Passwords used to access 
Azure network devices are restricted to authorized individuals and system processes based on job responsibilities 


--- Page 70 ---
 
67 
 
and are changed on a periodic basis. Mobile devices connected to the production environment are limited to Secure 
Access Workstation (SAW) laptops and do not include phones or tablet. 
In the unlikely event where JIT temporary access cannot be used, Azure service teams have the ability to access the 
production environment using designated break-glass accounts which provide user a short-term admin level 
access. Alerting and monitoring has been enabled for all break-glass accounts access. Upon accessing a break-
glass account an alert is generated, whereupon the service team will investigate and determine if the access was 
appropriate. 
Production assets that are not domain-joined or require local user accounts for authentication, require unique 
identifiers tied to individual user that requires appropriate approvals prior to being granted access. Non-domain-
joined user accounts, that are not required due to termination of user or change in user’s role and responsibilities, 
are removed manually within a stipulated period of termination / role change. In addition, access through persistent 
interactive local accounts on servers are not considered within user access as they are configured to raise security 
alert upon creations and are created on isolated VMs which tend to have a short life span. 
Packet Filtering  
Azure has implemented filtering platform with rule sets and guards to ascertain that the untrusted VMs cannot 
generate spoofed traffic, cannot receive traffic not addressed to them, cannot direct traffic to protected 
infrastructure endpoints, and cannot send or receive inappropriate broadcast traffic.  
VM based switch is designed and implemented through the filtering platform with Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) 
guards / rules to defend against ARP spoofing and related attacks. The guards / rules can be enabled on a per port 
basis to verify the sender’s Media Access Control (MAC) Address and IP address to prevent spoofing of outgoing ARP 
packets, and only allow inbound ARP packets to reach a VM if they are targeted at that VM’s IP address.  
Storage nodes run only Azure-provided code and configuration, and access control is thus narrowly tailored to 
permit legitimate customer, applications, and administrative access only.  
Virtual Local Area Network Isolation  
Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) are used to isolate FC and other devices. VLANs partition a network such that 
no communication is possible between VLANs without passing through a router.  
The Azure network in any datacenter is logically segregated into the Fabric core VLAN that contains trusted FCs and 
supporting systems and a VLAN that houses the rest of the components including the customer VMs.  
Platform Secrets 
Platform secrets, including certificates, keys, and Storage Account Keys (SAKs) are used for internal communication 
and are managed in a secure store that is restricted to authorized Azure personnel. 
Access to Customer Virtual Machines by Azure Personnel 
By default, user accounts are not created, and the Windows default administrator account is disabled on customer 
PaaS VMs. However, access to the customer VMs may be required for exceptional situations such as 
troubleshooting issues and handling incidents. In order to resolve these types of issues, temporary access 
procedures have been established to provide temporary access for Azure personnel to customer data and 
applications with the appropriate approvals. These temporary access events (i.e., request, approval and revocation 
of access) are logged and tracked using an internal ticketing system per documented procedures.  
Network Device Remote Access  
Azure network device access is provided through TACACS+ and local accounts, and follows standard logical access 
procedures as established by the Azure Networking team.

Directory and Organizational Identity Services Access Management 
Customer Authentication Credentials 
Each online customer is assigned a unique identity. Appropriate password hashing algorithms are in place to ensure 
that the authentication credential data stored is protected and is unique to a customer.  
Remote Desktop 
Production servers are configured to authenticate via AD. Directory and Organizational Identity Services’ production 
servers require users to perform two-factor authentication using a smart card and domain password to gain access 
to the Microsoft Directory Store production servers using the Remote Desktop Connection application. Remote 
Desktop Connection has encryption settings enforced. These settings are controlled using the domain group policy 
within the production servers. The settings enforce remote desktop connections made to the production server to 
be encrypted.  
Data Security 
Data Classification and Confidentiality Policy  
Data (also referred to as information and asset) is classified into twelve categories, as described in the Data section 
above, based on how it is used or may be used within the Service environment.  
There is one other type of data which is sometimes referenced in relation to data classification and protection. 
Azure does not treat this as a single category. Instead, it may contain data from one or more data classes described 
in the Data section above.  
• 
Personally Identifiable Information (PII): Any data that can identify an individual is PII. Within Azure, PII of 
Azure subscription / tenant administrators (direct customers) is treated differently from the PII of end-users of 
services hosted in Azure. This is because in order to provide the Azure service, access to Administrator PII is 
needed, such as in the event of outage related notifications. 
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) introduces new rules for organizations that offer goods and services 
to people in the European Union (EU), or that collect and analyze data for EU residents no matter where they are 
located. 
Cryptographic Controls 
Cryptographic controls and approved algorithms are used for information protection within the Azure platform and 
implemented based on the Azure Cryptographic Policy and Microsoft Cryptographic Standards. Cryptographic keys 
are managed throughout their lifecycle (e.g., ownership, generation, storage, distribution, periodic rotation, 
revocation, deactivation and archival) in accordance with established key management procedures. Access to 
cryptographic keys is restricted through security groups membership and use of JIT. Azure provides customers the 
ability to manage their own data encryption keys. 
Backup  
Processes have been implemented for the backup of critical Azure components and data. Backups are managed by 
the Azure Data Protection Services (DPS) team and scheduled on a regular frequency established by the respective 
component teams. The DPS team monitors backup processes for failures and resolves them per documented 
procedures to meet required backup frequency and retention. Azure teams that support the services and the 
backup process conducts integrity checks through standard restoration activities. Further, production data is 
encrypted on backup media.  
Backup restorations are performed periodically by appropriate individuals. Results of the test are captured and any 
findings are tracked to resolution. 


--- Page 72 ---
 
69 
 
Offsite backups are tracked and managed to maintain accuracy of the inventory information. Azure is moving from 
offsite tape-based storage solutions to use of storage accounts in regions or locations different from the primary 
data location. 
Access to backup data follows the same procedures defined under the Operator Access section above. 
Data Protection Services  
The DPS group has implemented a secure backup system infrastructure to provide secure backup, retention, and 
restoration of data in the Microsoft Online Services environment. Data is encrypted prior to backup and in transit 
where applicable, and can be stored on tape, disk, or Storage accounts based on the service requirements.  
Data Redundancy and Replication 
Azure Storage provides data redundancy to minimize disruptions to the availability of customer data. The data 
redundancy is achieved through fragmentation of data into extents which are copied onto multiple nodes within a 
region. This approach minimizes the impact of isolated Storage node failures and loss of data.  
Critical Azure components that support delivery of customer services have been designed to maintain high 
availability through redundancy and automatic failover to another instance with minimal disruption to customer 
services. Agents on each VM monitor the health of the VM. If the agent fails to respond, the FC reboots the VM. In 
case of hardware failure, the FC moves the role instance to a new hardware node and reprograms the network 
configuration for the service role instances to restore the service to full availability. 
Customers can also leverage the geographically distributed nature of the Azure infrastructure by creating a second 
Storage account to provide hot-failover capability. In such a scenario, customers may create custom roles to 
replicate and synchronize data between Microsoft facilities. Customers may also write customized roles to extract 
data from Storage for offsite private backups.  
Data is backed up to a region or location different from the primary data location and retained as per the retention 
policy. 
Azure Storage maintains three replicas of customer data in blobs, tables, queues, files, and disks across three 
separate fault domains in the primary region. Customers can choose to enable geo-redundant storage, in which 
case three additional replicas of that same data will be kept also across separate fault domains in the paired region 
within the same geography. Examples of Azure Regions are North and South US or North and West Europe. These 
regions are separated by several hundred miles. Geo-replication provides additional data durability in case of a 
region wide disaster. For Azure Government, the geo-replication is limited to regions within the United States. 
For Azure SQL that relies on Service Fabric, there are a minimum of three replicas of each database - one primary 
and two secondary replicas. If any component fails on the primary replica, Azure SQL detects the failure and fails 
over to the secondary replica. In case of a physical loss of the replica, Azure SQL creates a new replica 
automatically. 
All critical platform metadata is backed up in an alternate region several hundred miles from the primary copy. 
Backup methods vary by service and include Azure Storage geo-replication, Azure SQL geo-replication, service-
specific backup processes, and backup to tape. Azure manages and maintains all backup infrastructure. 
Data Segregation 
Directory Services assigns each tenant a unique identifier as part of the Active Directory. The mapping between the 
tenant and the AD location is represented within the partition table and is hidden from each customer tenant. Each 
tenant is segregated and partitioned within AD forest(s) based on this unique identifier to ensure appropriate 
customer data segregation. 


--- Page 73 ---
 
70 
 
Customer Data Deletion 
Customer metadata is collected, retained, and removed based on documented procedures. Customer data is 
retained in the Online Service in a limited function account for 90 days after expiration or termination of customer’s 
subscription so that the customer may extract the data. After the 90 day retention period ends, the customer’s 
account is disabled and the customer’s data is deleted. In accordance with applicable retention policies and legal / 
regulatory requirements as described in the Customer Registration section of the subscription, customer data is 
securely disposed of upon customer instruction. Hard disk and offsite backup tape destruction guidelines have 
been established for appropriate disposal. Customer accounts in non-payment or in violation of terms, etc., are 
subject to involuntary terminations and account disablement.  
Platform Communication and Customer Secrets Protection 
Data integrity is a key component of the Azure Platform. Customer secrets such as Storage Account Keys are encrypted during 
storage and transit. The customer facing portals and APIs only allow access to the Azure platform over a secure channel based on 
the service.  
Azure Platform Communication  
Internal communication between key Azure components where customer data is transmitted and involved is 
secured using SSL and TLS. SSL and TLS certificates are self-signed, except for those certificates that are used for 
connections from outside the Azure network (including the Storage service and the FC). These certificates are 
issued by a Microsoft Certificate Authority. Customer data is transmitted over a secure channel to the Azure 
platform services.  
Customer Secrets 
Customer secrets, including certificates, private keys, RDP passwords and SAKs are communicated through the 
SMAPI via the REST protocol, or Azure Portal over a secured channel using SSL. Customer secrets are stored in an 
encrypted form in Azure Storage accounts. Customer secrets are only known to the customer. Further, private root 
keys belonging to Azure services are protected from unauthorized access. 
Access Control Service Namespace 
Customers interact with the Access Control Service namespace over the web and service endpoints. Access 
Control Service namespace is only accessible through HTTPS and uses SSL to encrypt transmission of customer 
secrets including cryptographic keys, passwords and certificates over external networks. The customer information 
transmitted to all the Access Control Service endpoints is encrypted over external networks.  
Change Management 
The Change Management process has been established to plan, schedule, approve, apply, distribute, and track 
changes, including emergency changes to the production environment through designated responsibilities with the 
objective of minimizing risk and customer impact. It further controls the integrity and reliability of the environment 
while maintaining the pace of change required for business purposes.  
The change management process requires changes to be submitted per a pull request which is then checked into a 
production build once secondary review and approval is obtained. The production build then undergoes release 
testing, review and deployment approval prior to being released to Azure production environments. 
Separation of Environments 
Azure has implemented segregated environments for development, test and production, as a means to support 
segregation of duties and prevent unauthorized changes to production. Azure maintains logical and / or physical 
separation between the DEV (development), TEST (pre-production) and PROD (production) environments. Virtual 
services run on different clusters in separate network segments. TEST and PROD environments reside in separate 
network segments, which are accessed through distinct TEST and PROD Jumpboxes. Access to TEST and PROD 
Jumpboxes is restricted to authorized personnel from the service Operations and Production Support teams. 


--- Page 74 ---
 
71 
 
Deployment of software to production must meet testing and operational readiness criteria at each pre-production 
and production stage, and be approved prior to release. Production deployments use approved software builds and 
images. 
In addition, production data is not used or copied to non-production environments. Test scripts and synthetic data 
are created for use in the development and test environments. 
Segregation of Duties 
Segregation of duties is established on critical functions within the Azure environment, to minimize the risk of 
unauthorized changes to production systems. Responsibilities for requesting, approving and implementing changes 
to the Azure environment are segregated among designated teams.  
Software and Configuration Changes 
Software and configuration changes within Azure, including major releases, minor releases, hot fixes, and 
emergency changes are managed through a formal change and release management procedure, and tracked using 
a centralized ticketing system. The categorization of these changes is based on priority and risk associated with the 
change. Changes are requested, approved, tracked and implemented throughout the release lifecycle, which 
includes product and engineering planning, release management, deployment and post-deployment support 
phases. Change requests are documented, assessed for their risks and evaluated / approved for acceptance by the 
designated Azure personnel. Software releases are discussed, planned, and approved through the daily coordinated 
meetings with appropriate representatives from the service and component teams.  
Changes that are made to the source code are controlled through an internal source code repository. Refer to the 
Secure Development section for the controls enforced on the source code. Applicable operational security and 
internal control requirements are documented and implemented for Azure services based on Microsoft SDL 
methodology. 
Formal security and quality assurance testing is performed prior to the software release through each pre-
production environment (i.e., development and stage) based on defined acceptance criteria. The results of the 
quality assurance testing are reviewed and approved by the appropriate representatives prior to moving the release 
to production. For changes being deployed to the sovereign clouds, the change is tested in an Azure pre-production 
environment which is then deployed to the sovereign cloud production environment by the sovereign cloud data 
custodian after obtaining an additional approval from the sovereign cloud operator(s). Changes are reviewed for 
their adherence to established change and release management procedures prior to closure. Once deployed, 
changes are monitored for success; failed implementations are immediately rolled back and the change is not 
considered as completed until it is implemented and validated to operate as intended. 
All activity performed, including changes made, using a user’s break-glass account is logged and alerted. Service 
teams will review activity to ensure any changes made were appropriate. 
Azure has implemented tools to perform integrity verification checks to detect unauthorized changes to software, 
firmware and information. 
Hardware Changes 
Hardware changes are managed through formal change and release management procedures and a centralized 
ticketing system. Hardware changes are evaluated against the release entrance criteria that are established by the 
Azure Build-Out team, which forms the acceptance criteria for build-out of hardware within the Azure environment. 
Similar to software changes, the infrastructure changes are discussed and planned through the daily coordinated 
meetings with representatives from service and component teams. 
The Azure Build-Out team coordinates scheduling of the release and deployment of the change into the production 
environment. The Azure Build-Out team performs the build-out of hardware devices and post build-out validation in 


--- Page 75 ---
 
72 
 
coordination with the Azure Deployment Engineering team to verify its adherence to the hardware build 
requirements for new clusters. Azure Operations Managers perform final review and sign off of new deployments 
and Azure Build-Out team closes the ticket. 
Network Changes 
The Azure teams have implemented a formal change management process and centralized ticketing tool to 
document network changes and their approvals. Network changes include configuration changes, emergency 
changes, ACLs changes, patches, and new deployments. 
ACL changes, that are identified and categorized as a standard change, are considered as pre-approved and may be 
implemented on peer review. Non-standard changes are reviewed for their characteristics and risks, and approved 
by representatives from the Cloud + AI Security and Networking teams, during the daily coordinated meeting. 
Reviews and approvals are also tracked in a centralized ticketing system. Changes are performed through approved 
change implementers that are part of a designated security group. Post-implementation reviews are performed by 
qualified individuals, other than the implementer, who evaluate the change success criteria. 
Software Development 
Secure Development  
Azure’s software development practices, across each of the component teams, are aligned with the Microsoft SDL 
methodology. The SDL introduces security and privacy control specifications during the feature / component design 
and throughout the development process, which are reviewed through designated security roles. The SDL review for 
each service is performed on an annual basis. 
The Cloud + AI Security team creates the SDL baseline for Azure services to follow. The SDL baseline includes tasks 
to be performed which identify tools or processes that ensure teams are developing their services in a secured 
manner. As part of onboarding onto the SDL process, the Cloud + AI Security team works with the service teams to 
determine any additional SDL steps to be performed specific to the service. Additionally, teams are required to 
perform threat modeling exercises which are reviewed and approved by the Cloud + AI Security team. Each team 
has an SDL Owner who is responsible for ensuring appropriate completion of the SDL tasks. The SDL Owner reviews 
the SDL tasks and gives the overall sign off for completion of the SDL process. 
Authorized system changes are promoted from test, pre-production and production per the software change and 
release management process as described in the Change Management section. 
Source Code Control 
The Azure source code is stored within Azure’s internal source code repository tools that function as the versioning 
system for the source code. The tools track the identity of the person who checks source code out, and what 
changes are made. Procedures are established to approve source code changes made to source code repository. In 
addition, source code builds are scanned for malware prior to production release. 
Vulnerability Management 
Logging and Monitoring 
The Cloud + AI Security team has implemented agent-based monitoring infrastructure or custom script-based 
monitoring within the Azure environment to provide automated logging and alerting capabilities. The logging 
solutions are enabled on all production systems. The monitoring system detects potential unauthorized activity and 
security events such as the creation of unauthorized local users, local groups, drivers, services, or IP configurations. 
The monitoring agents are responsible for monitoring a defined set of user and administrator events, aggregating log 
events and sending the aggregated abnormal log information to a centralized log repository either at regular intervals 
or in real-time. Availability of logging and monitoring software is monitored by internal tools on a continuous basis, 
and responsible personnel are notified in case of any failure.  


--- Page 76 ---
 
73 
 
Logging servers are required to authenticate over encrypted channel to access logs generated within the production 
environment. Access to logging and monitoring infrastructure is restricted to authorized personnel.  
Component teams (e.g., Fabric and Storage) determine the specific events that need to be captured in 
consideration with a baseline. Administrator, operator, and system activities performed, such as logon / logoff 
within the Azure environment, are logged and monitored. As such, Azure components are configured to use 
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and the clocks are synchronized with the domain controller server. 
For network devices, the Azure Networking team monitors, logs, and reports on critical / suspicious activities and 
deviations from established baseline security configuration for the network devices. Predefined events are reported, 
tracked, and followed up on and security data is available for forensic investigations. The logs are retained centrally 
for forensic related analysis and access to the logs follows the same procedures defined under Operator Access 
section above. 
The Cloud + AI Security team has implemented an alerting system to provide real-time alerting through automatic 
generation of emails and alarms based on the log information captured by the monitoring infrastructure. 
Component teams are responsible for configuring the events to be alerted. The event and warning logs are routinely 
examined for anomalous behavior and when necessary, appropriate actions are taken in accordance with the 
incident handling procedures described in the Incident Management section. The Cyber Defense Operations Center 
(CDOC), Azure Live Site, and component teams manage response to malicious events, including escalation to and 
engaging specialized support groups. In addition, the CDOC interacts and communicates with relevant external 
parties to stay up-to-date and share current threat scenarios and countermeasures. 
Azure provides logging mechanisms that can be configured by customers to log activities and performance metrics 
related to their resources. 
System Monitoring Tools  
1. Geneva Monitoring within the Azure platform provides automated centralized logging and alerting capabilities 
for monitoring system use and detection of potential unauthorized activity. The Geneva Monitoring capabilities 
include Data Collection, Data Aggregation, Data Analysis and Information Access.  
2. Alert and Incident Management System (IcM) provides alerting on a real-time basis by automatically generating 
emails and incident tickets based on the log information captured in Geneva Monitoring.  
3. Azure Security Monitoring (ASM) provides logging and alerting capabilities upon detection of breaches or 
attempts to breach Azure platform trust boundaries. Critical security event logs generated are configured to 
alert through IcM. ASM monitors key security parameters to identify potentially malicious activity on Azure 
nodes.  
4. Microsoft Endpoint Protection (MEP) guards against malware and helps improve security of the Azure PaaS 
Guest customers, Azure infrastructure tenants and Azure internal applications. MEP can be configured to 
enable antimalware protection for the Azure infrastructure tenants and Azure PaaS Guest VMs. Microsoft’s 
antimalware endpoint solutions are designed to run quietly in the background without requiring human 
intervention. If malware is detected, the endpoint protection agent automatically takes action to remove the 
detected threat.  
5. System Center Endpoint Protection (SCEP) guards against malware and helps improve security for Azure IaaS 
and physical servers. SCEP solution is designed to run in the background and check for updates at least daily 
without requiring human intervention. If malware is detected, the endpoint protection agent automatically takes 
action to remove the detected threat. 
6. ClamAV is implemented to monitor for malicious software in the Linux based server environment. ClamAV 
performs at least daily checks for updates. If malware is detected, the endpoint protection agent automatically 
takes action to remove the detected threat. 


--- Page 77 ---
 
74 
 
7. Windows Defender guards against malware and helps improve security of the Azure PaaS, IaaS, and physical 
servers running Windows Server 2016 and newer. Windows Defender can be configured to enable antimalware 
protection for the Azure infrastructure tenants and Azure PaaS Guest VMs. Microsoft’s antimalware solutions 
are designed to run quietly in the background without requiring human intervention. If malware is detected, the 
Windows Defender automatically takes action to remove the detected threat. 
In addition, the Azure Live Site team uses third-party external monitoring services to monitor service health and 
performance (including the logging and monitoring tools). 
Network Monitoring 
The Networking team maintains a logging infrastructure and monitoring processes for network devices. In addition, 
the Azure Live Site team uses WaNetMon and third-party external monitoring services to monitor network 
connectivity. In addition, OneDDoS service is implemented on the Azure network to detect and respond to network-
based attacks. 
Vulnerability Scanning 
Cloud + AI Security team carries out frequent internal and external scans to identify vulnerabilities and assess the 
effectiveness of the patch management process. Services are scanned for known vulnerabilities; new services are 
added to the next timed quarterly scan, based on their date of inclusion, and follow at least a quarterly scanning 
schedule thereafter. These scans are used to ensure compliance with baseline configuration templates, validate 
that relevant patches are installed and identify vulnerabilities. The scanning reports are reviewed by appropriate 
personnel and remediation efforts are conducted in a timely manner. 
Patching 
The service and component teams are notified by the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) upon 
identification of technical vulnerabilities applicable to the Azure Windows-based systems. Azure works with MSRC 
to evaluate patch releases and determine applicability and impact to Azure and other Microsoft Online Services 
environments and customers. For Linux based systems, the Ubuntu Security Notices for Linux patches are relied 
upon as the primary source. The applicable security patches are applied immediately or during a scheduled release 
to the Azure environment based on the severity of the vulnerability.  
Processes are in place to evaluate patches and their applicability to the Azure environment. Once patches have 
been reviewed and their criticality level determined, service teams determine the release cadence for implementing 
patches without service disruption. 
Applicable patches are automatically applied to Guest PaaS VMs unless the customer has configured the VM for 
manual upgrades. In this case, the customer is responsible for applying patches.  
Teams follow a change process to modify the underlying OS within the platform. All changes are reviewed and 
tested, at a minimum, for their quality, performance, impact on other systems, recovery objectives and security 
features before they are moved into production using a defined release process. Test windows have been 
established for reviewing and testing of new features, and changes to existing features and patches.  
Patches are released through the periodic OS release cycle in accordance with change and release management 
procedures. Emergency out-of-band security patches (e.g., Software Security Incident Response Process patches) 
are expedited for more immediate release.  
Securing Edge Sites 
All drives and operating systems used for production servers that reside in edge locations are encrypted. The drives 
have ‘Always On’ encryption and stay encrypted even during OS patching and updates. In addition, all unused IO 
ports on production servers that reside in edge locations are disabled by OS-level configurations that are defined in 


--- Page 78 ---
 
75 
 
the baseline security configuration. Continuous configuration validation checks are enabled to detect drift in the 
OS-level configurations. 
In addition, intrusion detection switches are enabled to detect physical access of the device. An alert is sent to an 
operator and the affected servers are shut down and its secrets are revoked. The alerting and tracking follows the 
incident response process as defined below. 
Penetration Testing 
Penetration Testing (PEN Test) is performed at least annually on the Azure environment by an independent third 
party. The PEN Test scope is determined based on Azure’s areas of risk and compliance requirements. PEN Test 
findings are remediated based on criticality.  
Incident Management 
Azure has implemented an incident management framework that includes defined processes, roles, 
communications, responsibilities and procedures for detection, escalation and response to incidents internally and 
to customers. Azure reviews the vulnerability and incident management standard operating procedures annually. 
Azure reviews the implementation of these procedures as part of their internal monitoring and changes are made as 
often as needed to support continuous improvement of these processes and procedures. 
Security Incident - Internal Monitoring and Communication  
Azure has established incident response procedures and centralized tracking tools which consist of different 
channels for reporting production system incidents and weaknesses. Automated mechanisms include system 
monitoring processes for alerting the Azure Live Site, Cyber Defence Operations (CDO), and service On-Call teams 
per defined and configured event, threshold or metric triggers. Incidents may also be reported via email by different 
Azure or Microsoft groups such as the service and component teams, Azure Support team or datacenter teams. 
Users are made aware of their responsibilities of reporting incidents that shall be looked into without any negative 
consequences. The Azure Live Site, CDO, and service On-Call teams provide 24x7 event / incident monitoring and 
response services. The teams assess the health of various components of Azure and datacenters, along with access 
to detailed information when issues are discovered. Processes are in place to enable temporary access to customer 
VMs. Access is only granted during, and for the duration of, a specific incident. 
Additionally, CDO conducts yearly tests of the Incident Management SOPs and response capabilities. Reports 
related to information security events are provided to Azure management on a quarterly basis. Problem statements 
for systemic issues are submitted to Information Security Management Forum for executive leadership review. 
Incident Handling  
Azure teams use the established incident classification, escalation and notification process for assessing an 
incident’s criticality and severity, and accordingly escalating to the appropriate groups for timely action. The Azure 
Live Site and CDO teams, with assistance from additional Azure teams (e.g., Cloud + AI Security team, component 
teams for investigation, when necessary), document, track, and coordinate response to incidents.  
Incident Post-Mortem  
Post-mortem activities are conducted for customer impacting incidents or incidents with high severity ratings (i.e., 
levels 0 and 1). The post-mortems are reviewed by the Azure Operations Management team during weekly and 
monthly review meetings with Azure senior management. Incident and security post-mortem trends are reviewed 
and evaluated on a periodic basis and, where necessary, the Azure platform or security program may be updated to 
incorporate improvements identified as a result of incidents.

Network Problem Management 
The Networking team comprises Problem Management, Network Escalations, and Network Security teams to 
identify and address security alerts and incidents. The Networking team is responsible for identifying and analyzing 
potential problems and issues in the Microsoft Online Services networking environment.  
Physical and Environmental Security 
Datacenter Services 
The Datacenter Management team has overall responsibility for the oversight of datacenter operations, including 
physical security, site services (server deployments and break-fix work), infrastructure build-out, critical 
environment operations and maintenance, and facilities management. Site Security Officers are responsible for 
monitoring the physical security of the facility 24x7x365. 
Third-party vendors may perform various services in a Microsoft datacenter. For example:  
• 
Mission critical vendors may be responsible for maintaining the datacenter’s critical environment equipment. 
• 
Security vendors may manage the site security guard force. 
• 
General facilities management vendors may be responsible for minor building-related services, such as 
telephones, network, cleaning, trash removal, painting, doors, and locks. 
• 
Site Services may support the Microsoft Online Services operations. 
Datacenter Physical Security Management reviews and approves the incident response procedure on a yearly basis. 
The security incident response procedure details the appropriate steps to be taken in the event of a security incident 
and the methods to report security weaknesses. 
Physical Security  
Main access to the datacenter facilities are typically restricted to a single point of entry that is manned by security 
personnel. The main interior or reception areas have electronic card access control devices on the perimeter 
door(s), which restrict access to the interior facilities. Rooms within the Microsoft datacenters that contain critical 
systems (servers, generators, electrical panels, network equipment, etc.) are restricted through various security 
mechanisms, such as electronic card access control, keyed lock on each individual door, man traps, and / or 
biometric devices.  
Access Controls 
The Datacenter Management team has implemented operational procedures to restrict physical access to only 
authorized employees, contractors, and visitors. Temporary or permanent access requests are tracked using a 
ticketing system. Badges are either issued or activated for personnel requiring access after verification of 
identification. The Datacenter Management team is responsible for reviewing datacenter access on a regular basis 
and for conducting a quarterly audit to verify individual access is still required. 
Datacenter Security Personnel 
Security personnel in the datacenter conduct the following activities for various datacenter facilities:  
1. Man the security desks located at the main entrance of the datacenter  
2. Conduct periodic inspections of the datacenter through walkthroughs  
3. Respond to fire alarms and safety issues  
4. Dispatch security personnel to assist service requests and emergencies  
5. Provide Datacenter Management team with periodic updates about security events and entry logs  
6. Operate and monitor datacenter surveillance systems 


--- Page 80 ---
 
77 
 
Security Surveillance  
Datacenter surveillance systems monitor critical datacenter areas like datacenter main entry / exit, datacenter co-
locations entry / exit, cages, locked cabinets, aisle ways, shipping and receiving areas, critical environments, 
perimeter doors, and parking areas. Surveillance recordings are retained for 90 days or as the local law dictates.  
Emergency Power and Facility and Environmental Protection 
Microsoft datacenter facilities have power backup and environmental protection systems. Datacenter Management 
team or the contracted vendor performs regular maintenance and testing of these systems. 
Logical Access 
Customer Data and Systems Access Management (Customers) 
Customer Registration 
Azure customers register for Azure services by setting up a subscription through the MOCP using a Microsoft 
Account or Organizational Account. Additionally, depending on the service, customers have the ability to register for 
the service via the service specific portal. MOCP, including billing and registration, and Microsoft Account / 
Organizational Account, including password management, are not in scope of this SOC report.  
After registration, customers can request the creation of Storage accounts, hosted services, tenants, roles, and role 
instances within their subscription using the Azure Portal or programmatically through the Service Management API 
(SMAPI), which is the HTTPS interface exposed to external customers. The SMAPI allows customers to deploy and 
manage their services and their account. Among other things, this involves the ability to modify hosted services and 
Storage accounts, pick the geo-location for these accounts and place them in affinity groups, update 
configurations, ‘swap’ deployments and in essence, do all the non-creation related deployment / management 
operations that customers can do through the Azure Portal.  
Additionally, customers can utilize the Microsoft Entra ID Graph API for programmatic access to Microsoft Entra ID 
through REST API endpoints. Applications can use the Graph API to perform create, read, update and delete (CRUD) 
operations on directory data and objects, e.g., common operations for a user object like create new users in 
directory, get user details, update user properties, and ascertain role-based access for user’s group membership. 
Customers can also use the Microsoft Entra ID Module for Windows PowerShell cmdlets (provisioning API) to 
automate a number of deployment and management tasks. Azure has published a standard set of APIs with an 
ecosystem of tools and libraries on the Microsoft public website. All APIs or SDKs that services offer must be 
documented for interoperability and portability. 
Virtual Machine Customization 
Upon creation of a VM, the VM image allows customizations to performance, security and productivity. However, 
the image may be customized further by the customer to suit their needs. Hardening of the image is the 
responsibility of the customer. Access to the images may be restricted by the customer and updates to available 
images are communicated through customer-facing websites. 
Identity and Access Management 
Access to the Azure subscription through the Azure Portal is controlled by the Microsoft Account / Organizational 
Account. The ability to authenticate with the Microsoft Account / Organizational Account associated with the Azure 
subscription grants full control to all of the hosted services and Storage accounts within that subscription. (Note: 
Microsoft Account / Organizational Account and its associated authentication mechanisms are not in scope of this 
SOC report). 
User sessions in the Azure portal can be configured by customers to automatically sign the user out of the Azure 
Portal session after a stipulated period of inactivity, protecting resources from unauthorized activity. The session 
will automatically terminate when the device’s active focus is not on the Azure Portal for the stipulated period 
defined in the “Signing out + notifications” settings. 


--- Page 81 ---
 
78 
 
Location awareness technologies are implemented as part of the Azure Portal where location of the machine used 
for authentication is factored into the validation of the user identity. Where the user identity cannot be validated, 
Azure Portal would require the user to provide additional information to confirm their identity that could include MFA 
and / or secondary contact information for verification. 
Applications can also access Azure services by using APIs (also known as SMAPI). SMAPI authentication is based on 
a user-generated public / private key pair and self-signed certificate registered through the Azure Portal. It is the 
customer’s responsibility to safeguard the certificate.  
The certificate is then used to authenticate subsequent access to SMAPI. SMAPI queues request to the Fabric, 
which then provisions, initializes, and manages the required application. Customers can monitor and manage their 
applications via the Azure Portal or programmatically through SMAPI using the same authentication mechanism.  
In addition, customers can enable defined ports and protocols, e.g., RDP or SSH for Linux based services, on their 
instances and create local user accounts through the Azure Portal or SMAPI for debugging / troubleshooting issues 
with their applications. Customers are responsible for managing the local user accounts created.  
Logic Apps allows users to run jobs such as calling HTTP/S endpoints or posting messages to Azure Storage queues 
on any schedule. Jobs can be integrated with user applications and can be configured to run immediately, or on a 
recurring schedule or anytime in the future. Jobs can be configured to call services both inside and outside of Azure. 
Jobs are processed as per the job settings defined by the customer. In case an error occurs during the processing, 
the job is retried based on the retry interval as mentioned by the customer. Errors are monitored and appropriate 
action is taken based on the settings defined by the customer. Jobs configured by customer administrators are 
executed within thirty (30) minutes of the scheduled job run and are repeated based on the defined recurrence 
settings. 
Azure Automation allows users to create, monitor, manage, and deploy resources in the Azure environment using 
runbooks. These runbooks can be configured and schedules can be created to automate the manual, long-running, 
error-prone, and frequently repeated tasks that are commonly performed in a cloud environment.  
Services initialize the resource groups within the Azure Portal based on the customer configured templates. A 
customer tenant can create an Azure Resource Manager using an ARM template. The template deploys and 
provisions all resources for any application in a single, coordinated operation. In the template, a customer tenant 
can define the resources that are needed for the application and specify deployment parameters to input values for 
different environments. The template consists of JSON and expressions which the customer tenant can use to 
construct values for their deployment. Later, these resources under ARM can be accessed, monitor utilization, and 
reconfigure based on capacity utilization using the deployment parameters that were entered during ARM creation. 
Further, customer data is accessible within agreed upon services in data formats compatible with providing those 
services.  
Access to Customer Virtual Machines  
External traffic to customer VMs is protected via ACLs but can be configured by the customer to allow external 
traffic only to customer designated ports and protocols. There is no port that is open by default unless explicitly 
configured by the customer in the service definition file. Once configured, the Azure Fabric Controller automatically 
updates the network traffic rule sets to allow external traffic only to the customer designated ports.  
Customers can connect to their VMs via the ports and protocols defined by them, create credentials (i.e., username 
and password) and choose a certificate to encrypt the credentials during initial set-up that expires within 14 days 
through a secured mechanism. Authentication after set-up is performed using the self-created credentials. The 
connection is secured via Transport Layer Security (TLS) using a self-signed certificate generated by the VM 
instance. Customers can also upload custom certificates via the Azure Portal and configure their instances to use 
them securely.  


--- Page 82 ---
 
79 
 
Access to Customer Storage Account Data 
Access to Azure Storage (i.e., blobs, tables, queues, files and disks) is governed by the SAK that is associated with 
each Storage account. Access to the SAK provides full control over the data in the Storage account.  
Access to Azure Storage data can also be controlled through a Shared Access Signature (SAS). The SAS is created 
through a query template (URL), signed with the SAK. That signed URL can be given to another process, which can 
then fill in the details of the query and make the request of the Storage service. Authentication is still based on a 
signature created using the SAK, but it is sent to the Storage server by a third party. Access using the SAS can be 
limited in terms of validity time, permission set and what portions of the Storage account are accessible.  
Data security beyond the access controls described above, such as fine-grain access controls or encryption, is the 
responsibility of the customer with exception to Managed Disk where encryption is enabled by default.  
Identity and Access Management - Self Service Password Reset 
Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR) for users is a feature which allows end-users in customer organization to reset 
their passwords automatically without calling an administrator or helpdesk for support. SSPR has three main 
components: 
7. Password Reset Policy Configuration Portal - Administrators can control different facets of password reset 
policy in the Azure Portal. 
8. User Registration Portal - Users can self-register for password reset through a web portal. 
9. User Password Reset Portal - Users can reset their own passwords using a number of different challenges in 
accordance with the administrator-controlled password-reset policy. 
Customer Administrative Passwords 
The One Time Password (OTP) generation module is implemented as a worker role within the Azure AD platform and 
OTP used for self-service password reset are randomly generated. These OTPs expire after their usage or a pre-
defined time limit. OTP generated for email and SMS are validated. Additionally, the OTP values are to be provided 
within the same session where the OTP was requested. 
For the password reset process, the only information displayed within the HTTPS response packets is the masked 
phone number and cookies required to reset the password. The new passwords supplied by customer 
administrators within the SSPR portal adhere to the Azure AD password policy requirements. The SSPR portal is only 
accessible through HTTPS port and the new passwords supplied by the customers are encrypted during 
transmission over external networks. 
This also applies to the initial temporary password generated for the user. These temporary passwords have a pre-
defined time limit before it expires and forces users to change it on first usage. 
Quotas and Thresholds 
Where applicable, quotas are enforced on Azure services as configured by the service administrators. Quota name, 
the threshold value for the quota, and the behavior on exceeding the quota, have been specified to protect customer 
entities from availability related issues. 
Business Continuity and Resiliency 
Microsoft has established an organization-wide Enterprise Business Continuity Management (EBCM) framework 
that serves as a guideline for developing Azure Business Continuity Program. The program includes Business 
Continuity Policy, Implementation Guidelines, Business Impact Analysis (BIA), Risk Assessment, Dependency 
Analysis, Business Continuity Plan (BCP), Incident Management Plan, and procedures for monitoring and improving 
the program. The Business Continuity Management (BCM) Program Manager manages the program for Azure, and 
the datacenter Service Resiliency (SR) program is coordinated through the datacenter SR Program Management 
Office to ensure that the program adheres to a coherent long-term vision and mission, and is consistent with 
enterprise program standards, methods, policies, and metrics. 


--- Page 83 ---
 
80 
 
The Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) is intended for usage by Azure Incident Managers for the recovery from high 
severity incidents (disasters) for its critical processes. The BCP and DRP are reviewed periodically. 
The BCP and / or DRP includes scope and applicable dependencies for the services, restoration procedures, and 
communications with appropriate teams (i.e. Incident Management). The BCP and DRP are reviewed at least 
annually by a designated user and made available to all applicable users. The Business Continuity team conducts 
testing of the business continuity and disaster recovery plans established for Azure services, per the defined testing 
schedule for various loss scenarios. Each loss scenario is tested at least annually. Issues identified during testing 
are resolved and plans are updated accordingly. 
The BCM charter provides strategic direction and leadership to various aspects of the datacenter organization. The 
BCM program is coordinated through the Program Management Office to ensure that the program adheres to a 
coherent long-term vision and mission, and is consistent with enterprise program standards, methods, policies, and 
metrics. 
Azure Resiliency Program 
Azure has defined the BCP to serve as a guide to respond, recover and resume operations during a serious adverse 
event. The BCP covers the key personnel, resources, services and actions required to continue critical business 
processes and operations. This plan is intended to address extended business disruptions. The development of the 
BCP is based on recommended guidelines of Microsoft’s EBCM.  
In scope for this plan are Azure’s critical business processes (defined as needed within 24 hours or less). These 
processes were determined during a BIA, in which Azure estimated potential operational and financial impacts if 
they could not perform a process, and determined the Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective 
(RPO) of the process. Following the BIA, a Non-Technical Dependency Analysis was performed to determine the 
specific people, applications, vital records, and user requirements necessary to perform the process. The BCP’s 
scope covers only the critical business processes determined during the BIA.  
On a periodic basis, Azure performs testing of the BCP, or implementation of the plan due to a live event, to assess 
the effectiveness and usability of the BCP and to identify areas where risks can be eliminated or mitigated. Where 
applicable, third parties are involved in the test if there are dependencies associated with them. The results of 
testing are documented, validated and approved by appropriate personnel. This information is used to create and 
prioritize work items.  
Datacenter Service Resiliency Program 
As part of the datacenter SR program, the Datacenter Management team develops the methods, policies and 
metrics that address the information security requirements needed for the organization’s business continuity. The 
team develops BCPs and DRPs for the continued operations of critical processes and required resources in the 
event of a disruption.  
Additionally, the Datacenter Management team conducts and documents a resiliency assessment specific to the 
datacenter’s operations on an annual basis or prior to proposed significant changes.  
Capacity Management 
The Networking team continually monitors the network to ensure availability and addresses capacity issues in a 
timely manner. The process for weekly capacity review is initiated by the Network Capacity Management team. The 
review includes an analysis of the capacity based on various parameters and the Network Hotlist report. Actions 
identified from the review are assigned for appropriate resolution.  
Third Party Management  
Third parties undergo a review process through Global Procurement and an approved vendor list has been 
established. Purchase orders to engage a third-party require a Microsoft Master Vendor Agreement (MMVA) to be 


--- Page 84 ---
 
81 
 
established or a review to be performed by CELA. In addition to MMVA, a signed NDA is also required. Vendors 
requiring access to source code need to be approved by the General Manager and CELA, and sign a Source Code 
Licensing Agreement. 
Microsoft’s exit strategy for critical suppliers is to have multiple suppliers readily available in case an exit is needed. 
Each supplier is assessed against the same indicators of success and resource requirements. 
Periodic reviews are performed on third parties against their applicable SLAs and security requirements. Any 
findings from these reviews are tracked to resolution and / or require further reviews with the third party. 
Microsoft partners with third-party companies to help meet customers’ needs. These third-party companies are 
referred to as suppliers. 
Asset Management 
Azure assets are classified in accordance with Microsoft Online Services Classification guidelines. The 
classification process is owned by the Azure Global team. There are five categories for classification: Non-business, 
Public, General, Confidential, and Highly Confidential. Steps are taken to protect assets commensurate with the 
respective asset’s classification and its data sovereignty. Review of asset inventory, ownership, and classification is 
performed at least semi-annually. 
The Azure Scope Boundary inventory of servers is monitored and maintained by the Azure Inventory team. Azure 
inventory is maintained automatically ensuring complete, accurate, valid, and consistent inventory as it is 
automatically updated by all upstream data sources. 
Azure has created and implemented processes to control the delivery and removal of information assets through a 
centralized ticketing system. If equipment is shipped from multiple locations, a separate ticket must be created for 
each location. 
Communications 
Policies Communication 
Azure maintains communication with employees using the corporate intranet sites, email, training etc. The 
communications include, but are not limited to, communication of Azure policies and procedures, corporate 
events, new initiatives, and awareness on ISMS and Business Continuity Management System. Changes and 
updates to Azure policies and procedures, and all subsequent updates are distributed to all relevant stakeholders 
from the Azure Security, Privacy & Compliance intranet site.  
Service Level Agreements 
Azure details commitments made regarding delivery or performance of services. These details are published in the 
SLAs available on the following website: https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/.  
Customer Communication 
Prior to provisioning Azure services, customers are required to review and agree with the acceptable use of data and 
the Azure service, as well as security and privacy requirements, which are defined in the Microsoft Product Terms, 
Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement, Azure Platform Privacy Statement and Technical Overview of the Security 
Features in the Azure Platform.  
Subsequent communication with customers is primarily achieved through the following options:  
• 
Service Dashboard - Azure maintains and notifies customers of potential changes, events and incidents that 
may impact security, availability, processing integrity, or confidentiality of the services through an online Service 
Dashboard. The online Service Dashboard is updated in real time and RSS feeds are also available for 


--- Page 85 ---
 
82 
 
subscription. Service Dashboard is used to disclose nature, timing, extent, and disposition of the incidents 
impacting various services. 
• 
Legal - Any changes / updates to the Service Agreement, Terms, End User License Agreement (EULA), 
Acceptable Use Policy, Privacy Statement or SLAs are posted on the Azure website. The information presented 
in the Microsoft Trust Center is current as of the date at the top of each section, but is subject to change without 
notice. Customers are encouraged to review the Microsoft Trust Center periodically to be informed of new 
security, privacy and compliance developments.  
• 
Contact Information - Customers can communicate with Azure support in various ways. The contact section 
presents forum access and direct contact for support.  
Details around confidentiality and related security obligations for customer data, as well as the shared 
responsibility model that outlines responsibilities between Azure and its customers are communicated through the 
Microsoft Trust Center (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trustcenter/). The description of the services, their key 
components, and recommendations on secure use of those services are available to customers through the Azure 
Service Directory (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/). In addition, supported virtualization standards for 
the Azure environment are available on the Microsoft public website. 
MSRC identifies, monitors, responds to, and resolves security incidents and vulnerabilities in Microsoft software. 
The MSRC is on constant alert for security threats, monitoring security newsgroups, and responding to reported 
vulnerabilities - 365 days a year. Microsoft operating system updates for virtual machines are made available 
through Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) site and Windows Update. Customers and other third parties 
can report suspected vulnerabilities by emailing secure@microsoft.com. 
Baseline Configuration 
Baseline Security Configuration for Services 
Technical standards and baselines have been established and communicated for OS deployments. Automated 
mechanisms and periodic scanning have been deployed to detect and troubleshoot exceptions and / or deviations 
from the baseline in the production environment. Where applicable, mechanisms are in place for services to re-
image production servers with the latest baseline configuration at least on a monthly frequency. Further, OS and 
component teams review and update configuration settings and baseline configurations at least annually.  
Network Configuration 
The Networking team has implemented procedural and technical standards for the deployment of network devices. 
These standards include baseline configurations for network devices, network architecture, and approved protocols 
and ports. The Networking team regularly monitors network devices for compliance with technical standards and 
potential malicious activities.  
Processing Integrity 
Azure monitors the transactions invoked by the customer and relays them appropriately to the suitable RP end-
point. RDFE, ARM and Microsoft Azure Portal utilize Azure configuration files for determining the types of events that 
are to be recorded when processing a transaction. Additionally, monitoring rules have been defined to process the 
events that have been recorded and generate alerts per the severity of an event and forward the same to the 
required stakeholders in the process, so they can take appropriate action. Azure management reviews portal 
performance monthly through 1) live site reviews performed at the service level where service teams will review all 
outages and incidents that occurred subsequent to the prior live site review and 2) high level live site reviews where 
management reviews trends and contributing factors that cause outages to evaluate the performance of Azure 
services against compliance with customer SLA requirements. 
Requests made through Service Management API or the Azure Portal are segregated based on the subscription IDs 
and service requests are provisioned based on the parameters defined as per the customer’s request. The request 


--- Page 86 ---
 
83 
 
header contains the unique subscription ID of the user creating the request, the service requested and the request 
type allowing Azure to appropriately provision customer services. Azure performs input validation to restrict any 
non-permissible requests to the API which includes checking for validity of subscription IDs and the user, Denial of 
Service (DoS) attack mitigation, protection against XML bombs, namespace validation and header information. 
Changes to the Azure system 
The changes to the Azure system from October 1, 2024 to September 30, 2025 that would affect report users’ 
understanding of how the system is used are as follows: 
• 
Changes were made to the offerings/services, datacenter locations, and edge sites to reflect the current scope.

Section 4: Management of Microsoft’s Description of Its 
Relevant Criteria and Related Controls, and Independent 
Service Auditor’s Description of Tests of Controls and 
Results 
Description of testing procedures performed 
Deloitte & Touche LLP performed a variety of tests relating to the controls listed in this section throughout the period 
from October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025. Our tests of controls were performed on controls as they existed 
during the period of October 1, 2024, through September 30, 2025 and were applied to those controls specified by 
Microsoft Corporation. 
In determining the nature, timing, and extent of tests, we considered (a) the nature and frequency of the controls 
being tested, (b) the types of available evidential matter, (c) the assessed level of control risk, (d) the expected 
effectiveness of the test, and (e) our understanding of the control environment. 
In addition to the tests listed below, we ascertained through multiple inquiries with management and the control 
owner that each control activity listed below operated as described throughout the period. Tests performed are 
described below: 
Test 
Description 
Corroborative inquiry 
Conducted detailed interviews with relevant personnel to obtain evidence that the control 
was in operation during the report period and is accompanied by other procedures noted 
below that are necessary to corroborate the information derived from the inquiry. 
Observation 
Observed the performance of the control during the report period to evidence application of 
the specific control activity. 
Examination of 
documentation/inspection 
If the performance of the control is documented, inspected documents and reports 
indicating performance of the control. 
Reperformance of monitoring 
activities or manual controls 
Obtained documents used in the monitoring activity or manual control activity, 
independently reperformed the procedures, and compared any discrepancies identified with 
those identified by the responsible control owner.  
Reperformance of 
programmed processing 
Input test data, manually calculated expected results, and compared actual results of 
processing to expectations. 
 
Testing of tools supporting control activities 
For the tools used in the performance of control activities in Section 4, we performed procedures to address the 
risks associated with their use. While these procedures were not specifically included in the test procedures listed 
in Section 4, they were completed as part of the testing to support our conclusions. 
Reliability of information produced by the Service Organization 
We performed procedures to evaluate whether the information provided by the service organization, which includes 
(a) information in response to ad hoc requests from the service auditor (e.g., population lists), and (b) information 
used in the execution of a control (e.g., exception reports or transaction reconciliations), was sufficiently reliable for 
our purposes by obtaining evidence about the accuracy and completeness of such information and evaluating 
whether the information was sufficiently precise and detailed for our purposes.  


--- Page 89 ---
 
86 
 
Our procedures to evaluate whether this information was sufficiently reliable included procedures to address (a) the 
accuracy and completeness of source data, and (b) the creation and modification of applicable report logic and 
parameters. While these procedures were not specifically called out in the test procedures listed in this section, 
they were completed as a component of our testing to support the evaluation of whether or not the information is 
sufficiently precise and detailed for purposes of fully testing the controls identified by the Service Organization. 
Reporting on results of testing 
The concept of materiality is not applied when reporting the results of control tests because Deloitte & Touche LLP 
does not have the ability to determine whether an exception will be relevant to a particular user entity. 
Consequently, Deloitte & Touche LLP reports all exceptions. 
Results of Testing Performed 
The information regarding the tests of operating effectiveness is explained below in four parts: 
Part A: Contains the Trust Services Criteria, the related control activities that cover those criteria, and the results of 
the test procedures performed.  
Part B: Contains the details of the test procedures performed to test the operating effectiveness of the control 
activities, and the results of the testing performed.  
The applicable trust services criteria and Azure’s control activities in Part A and B are provided by Microsoft.

Microsoft 
The following information is provided for informational purposes only and has not been subjected to the procedures 
applied in the examination. Accordingly, Deloitte & Touche LLP expresses no opinion on the following information. 
Azure Compliance 
Microsoft Azure supports compliance with a broad set of industry-specific laws and meets broad international 
standards. Azure has ISO 27001, ISO 27017, ISO 27018, ISO 22301, and ISO 9001 certifications, PCI DSS Level 1 
validation, SOC 1 Type 2 and SOC 2 Type 2 attestations, HIPAA Business Associate Agreement, and HITRUST 
certification. Operated and maintained globally, Microsoft Azure is regularly and independently verified for 
compliance with industry and international standards, and provides customers the foundation to achieve 
compliance for their applications. More information is available from the Azure Compliance site. 
Infrastructure Redundancy and Data Durability 
Azure mitigates the risk of outages due to failures of individual devices, such as hard drives or even entire servers 
through the following: 
• 
Data durability of Azure Storage (Blobs (including Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2), Disks, Files, Queues, Tables) 
including Cool and Premium, facilitated by maintaining redundant copies of data on different drives located 
across fully independent physical storage subsystems. Copies of data are continually scanned to detect and 
repair bit rot. 
• 
Cloud Services availability, maintained by deploying roles on isolated groupings of hardware and network 
devices known as fault domains. The health of each compute instance is continually monitored and roles are 
automatically relocated to new fault domains in the event of a failure. 
• 
Network load balancing, automatic OS and service patching is built into Azure. The Azure application 
deployment model also upgrades customer applications without downtime by using upgrade domains, a 
concept similar to fault domains, which helps ascertain that only a portion of the service is updated at a time. 
Data Backup and Recovery  
In addition to the core data durability built into Azure, Azure provides customers with a feature to capture and store 
point-in-time backups of their stored Azure data. This allows customers to protect their applications from an event 
of corruption or unwanted modification or deletion of its data. 
Microsoft Azure E.U. Data Protection Directive 
Microsoft offers contractual commitments for the safeguarding of customer data as part of the Product Terms, 
Microsoft Licensing Terms and Documentation. 
• 
A Data Processing Agreement that details our compliance with the E.U. Data Protection Directive and related 
security requirements for Azure core features within ISO / IEC 27001:2013 scope. 
• 
E.U. Model Contractual Clauses that provide additional contractual guarantees around transfers of personal 
data for Azure core features within ISO / IEC 27001:2013 scope.

SDL - 1 
Development of new features 
and changes to the Azure 
services follow a defined 
approach based on the 
Microsoft Security 
Development Lifecycle (SDL) 
methodology. The SDL review 
for each service is performed 
on an annual basis. 
For 11 of the 35 sampled services, the 
SDL review was not completed within 
the annual cadence. 
Additionally, Internal Audit of 
Microsoft identified one sampled 
service in which two exceptions were 
not approved timely and by the 
appropriate personnel as per 
Microsoft's SDL Methodology. 
The Security Development Lifecycle 
(SDL) process includes both an annual 
attestation and continuous automated 
monitoring to ensure compliance with 
SDL requirements. Although the annual 
attestation for the 11 services was 
completed after the internal service 
level agreement deadline, management 
has confirmed that SDL requirements 
were consistently met throughout the 
audit period. This has been verified by 
the automated internal monitoring 
system. 
Out of the aforementioned 11 services, 
three were identified in the current 
testing period while the other nine were 
identified in prior testing periods. 
Additionally, Internal Audit discovered 
during their testing a sampled service 
did not follow the proper process for 
submitting an exception request. 
Subsequent to this finding, the 
exception request was submitted 
through the correct process and 
approved by the appropriate personnel. 
To help prevent future occurrences, the 
process has been enhanced to 
automatically facilitate following the 
correct process.  
Compliance with SDL requirements is

checks to detect unauthorized 
changes to software, firmware 
and information. 
In October 2024, Internal Audit of 
Microsoft noted that code-signing 
was not configured for five build 
pipelines associated with four of the 
in-scope services. 
No additional exceptions were noted 
in our independent testing. 
The observation from Internal Audit was 
made in October 2024 and has since 
been addressed, with all affected 
offerings to re-enabling code signing. 
Although code signing was not enabled 
at the time, all other change 
management controls to preserve the 
integrity and authenticity of code 
changes were met.

Procedures to monitor the 
Azure platform components 
for known security 
vulnerabilities have been 
established. Identified security 
vulnerabilities are remediated. 
For 2 of 39 sampled services, multiple 
vulnerabilities were not remediated in 
a timely manner. 
Additionally, Internal Audit of 
Microsoft identified multiple 
vulnerabilities associated with five in-
scope services that were not 
remediated in a timely manner. 
Of the two services identified, one was 
from the current testing period and the 
other from prior periods. For the current 
period, a sampled service supporting 
Microsoft Sentinel, Microsoft Sentinel 
Graph, and Security Platform Purview 
had vulnerabilities on virtual machines 
representing 0.02% of its servers; these 
did not host production code or support 
the runtime of these offerings. The 
affected assets have been deprecated 
and all identified vulnerabilities, 
including those from prior periods, have 
been remediated.  
For the assets identified to have 
untimely resolution to known 
vulnerabilities, several effective 
mitigating controls—such as endpoint 
encryption, network segmentation, 
packet filtering, and Security 
Information and Event Management 
(SIEM) were actively in place and 
effective throughout the period. 
PE - 4 
Physical access mechanisms 
(e.g., access card readers, 
biometric devices, man traps / 
portals, cages, locked 
cabinets) have been 
implemented and are 
administered to restrict 
access to authorized 
individuals. 
For 2 of 15 sampled datacenters 
tested during the period October 1, 
2024 to June 30, 2025, while various 
layers of physical access 
mechanisms were determined to be 
properly implemented, three 
instances of physical access 
mechanisms were not properly 
administered: 
- A trash door that provides access to 
the loading area was not fully closed. 
- While keycards were required to 
enter the generator area, several 
generator enclosures within the area 
that are normally secured with 
The physical access mechanism relates 
to a trash door that was not fully closed. 
This door only provides access to the 
loading area of the data center. 
Additionally, a secured gate requiring 
prior authorization controls entry into 
the data center perimeter, including the 
trash area. Since the door does not lead 
into the data center itself and access to 
the perimeter is restricted, 
management considers this finding to 
pose no risk. 
The second physical access 
mechanism pertains to the individual 
generator doors not being locked inside

temporary-use physical keys had

the generator area. Access to the 
generator area requires multiple layers 
of authorization to access and is 
governed by role-based access controls 
and subject to quarterly reviews. Once 
inside, personnel are considered 
appropriate to access the individual 
generator doors and internal policy 
does not require these sub-areas in the 
enclosure to be locked. Since access to 
the area is strictly controlled and there 
is no violation of internal policy, 
management considers this finding to 
pose no risk. 
The third physical access issue involves 
a faulty lock on an exterior door to the 
datacenter’s HVAC hallway, allowing 
potential forced entry. The faulty lock 
was mitigated through active alerting if 
forced entry occurred, surveillance 
coverage, and rapid physical security 
personnel response. All these 
mitigations were presented during 
testing upon discovery of the faulty 
lock. This multi-layered approach 
ensures prompt detection and 
resolution of access attempts, 
maintaining the facility’s security 
integrity. Furthermore, additional 
authorization layers prevented access 
beyond the HVAC hallway, and no 
unauthorized entry occurred despite 
the faulty lock. Each issue was fixed 
upon discovery. 
There have been no additional failures 
for this control since the June 30, 2025 
SOC report. 
PE - 5 
The datacenter facility is 
monitored 24x7 by security 
personnel. 
For 1 of 18 sampled cameras tested 
during the period October 1, 2024 to 
March 31, 2025, the tapes were not 
retained in accordance with the 
documented operating procedures. 
Furthermore, tested 18 sampled 
cameras subsequent to March 31, 
2025, and no additional exceptions 
were noted. 
The sampled camera experienced a 
hardware issue that prevented tape 
retention that has since been resolved; 
however, it did not affect the live CCTV 
feed or management’s ability to 
conduct 24/7 monitoring of the facility. 
Management obtained evidence of 
security patrol logs, footage from other 
facility cameras, and footage of the 
monitoring room - demonstrating that 
live monitoring remained effective. The 
issue has since been fixed after it was 
discovered. 
There have been no additional failures 
for this control since it was first 
identified in the March 31, 2025 SOC 
reports.
