PIMS and the supporting management system documentation. 
 
 
Context of the Organization (Clause 4 from ISO 27001 and Clause 5 from ISO 27701) 
 
Understanding the Organization and its Context (ISO 27001 Clause 4.1 and ISO 27701 Clause 5.2.1) 
Microsoft recognizes its need to protect critical business information in order to better serve their customers.  To 
achieve this, an ISMS has been created in accordance with the ISO 27001 standard in addition to the control 
requirements included in the ISMS based on the control sets within the ISO 27017, ISO 27018, and the PIMS 
processor requirements of ISO 27701.  The use of information assets must be in line with good professional working 
practices and procedures as well as statutory, regulatory, and contractual requirements and must ensure the 
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all Microsoft’s and Microsoft’s clients’ information assets.  Information is 
an extremely important Microsoft asset and enables Microsoft to fulfill its business functions and obligations to its 
clients.  Microsoft’s ISMS helps ensure that Microsoft meets all applicable statutory, regulatory, and contractual 
information security requirements and helps to provide the required client assurances regarding Microsoft’s 
approach to information security. 
 
During the implementation of the ISMS program, the Integrated Management Forum (IMF) identified and 
established objectives for achieving the intended outcomes of the ISMS and PIMS by evaluating the overall 
business risks and the ways to mitigate those risks.  The ISMS program implementation involved communicating 
the importance of information security management throughout the organization and clearly outlining and assigning 
roles and responsibilities to all employees who have an effect on the ISMS.   
 
Understanding the Needs and Expectations of Interested Parties (ISO 27001 Clause 4.2 and ISO 27701 Clause 
5.2.2) 
Microsoft Azure, Dynamics, and other Online Services considers input from the relevant interested parties to 
determine the obligations and expectations that Microsoft Azure, Dynamics, and other Online Services needs to 
meet.  Microsoft Azure, Dynamics, and other Online Services management engages with the relevant interested 
party, on a periodic basis, to discuss the requirements and align Microsoft Azure, Dynamics, and other online 
Services’ plans.   
 
Determining the Scope of the ISMS (ISO 27001 Clause 4.3 and ISO 27701 Clause 5.2.3) 
The scope of the ISMS and PIMS is defined and documented and most recently updated as of November 18, 2021.  
The scope of the ISMS and PIMS is reviewed by the Microsoft Azure compliance manager at least annually or upon 
significant changes to internal and external interested parties.  
 
The scope of the ISO 27001 scope expansion review was limited to the additional services and offerings being 
added to the ISMS and PIMS supporting Microsoft Azure, Dynamics, and other Online Services that were deployed 
in Azure Public, Government and Germany Cloud including their development, operations, and infrastructure and 
their associated security, privacy, and compliance and inclusive of the requirements and control implementation 
guidance of ISO 27701 for a PIMS as a data processor.   
 
The scope of the ISMS and PIMS comprises the development, operations and infrastructure teams for Azure and 
Azure based services deployed in Public, Government and Germany Cloud, collectively referred as Microsoft Azure 
in accordance with the statement of applicability, version 2021.03, dated October 20, 2021.  With respect to the 
processing of personal information within the scope of the PIMS, Microsoft has determined that it operates as a 
processor in relation to the services provided to customers. 
 
As part of scope expansion, 11 new service offerings were added to the scope of the ISMS.  The full listing services 
and offerings are summarized in Appendix A.   
 
The new service offerings and services are within the scope and boundaries of the ISMS which consisted of Cloud 
Operations & Infrastructure (CO&I) fully managed datacenters, remotely managed datacenters, the core servers 
providing critical shared services and management tools for the infrastructure, and the access network infrastructure

that supports these critical core services.  The only office facility included within the scope of the ISMS and PIMS 
is the office facility in Redmond, Washington.  For a listing of in-scope data centers, see Appendix A. 
 
Information Security Management System (ISO 27001 Clause 4.4 and ISO 27701 Clause 5.2.4) 
Microsoft has established an integrated management system (IMS) Scope Statement which serves as a framework 
to lead the implementation, maintenance, and continual improvement of the ISMS and PIMS in accordance with the 
requirements of the standards.  Such activities are demonstrated through its establishment of the IMF, which 
encompasses a select group of Microsoft’s department heads to integrate information security considerations into 
its day-to-day activities, fostering an environment of continual improvement. 
 
 
Leadership, Information Security Objectives, Organizational Structure, and Support (Clauses 5, 6, and 7) 
 
The requirements of Clauses 5 and 7 (Leadership, Organizational Structure, and Support) are well-defined in the 
ISMS Manual.  The following aspects of the ISMS were tested during 2021 scope expansion review and were noted 
to be unchanged during the scope expansion review: 
• 
Leadership and Commitment (Clause 5.1) 
• 
Policy (Clause 5.2) 
• 
Organizational Roles, Responsibilities, and Authorities (Clause 5.3) 
• 
Information Security Objectives and Planning to Achieve Them (Clause 6.2) 
• 
Resources (Clause 7.1) 
• 
Competence (Clause 7.2) 
• 
Awareness (Clause 7.3) 
• 
Communication (Clause 7.4) 
• 
Documented Information (Clause 7.5) 
 
Microsoft’s Leadership, Information Security Objectives, Organizational Structure, and Support clauses for its ISMS 
were not impacted as part of the scope expansion and were documented within the 2021 surveillance review report.  
As part of the scope expansion, the ISMS clauses were reviewed, and documents were provided to support that 
they were not impacted.  
 
 
Risk Identification, Risk Assessment, and Risk Treatment (Clauses 6 and 8 from ISO 27001 and Clause 5 
from ISO 27701) 
 
Microsoft’s risk assessment process allows the organization to assess, identify, and modify their overall security 
posture and to enable security, operations, organizational management, and other personnel to collaborate and 
view the entire organization from a vulnerability perspective.  The risk assessment process has obtained 
management’s commitment for the allocation of resources and for the implementation of appropriate security 
solutions to achieve the intended outcomes of the ISMS and PIMS, including preventing and mitigating undesired 
consequences, and continually improving. 
 
Microsoft’s risk assessment process is completed at least semi-annually, or when significant events occur.  Risk 
treatment activities are monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure risks are addressed and treatment plans are 
successfully executed. 
 
Microsoft has established a risk and exception SOP which documents the risk assessment process.  Risk 
assessments are performed by Global Azure teams to review the effectiveness of existing controls and safeguards 
as they pertain to information security and privacy, as well as to identify new risks.  These assessments ensure all 
policies and supporting procedures properly address the environment considering changing regulatory, contractual, 
business, technical, and operational requirements.

As part of the scope expansion to include the Microsoft Azure’s new offerings and services, the information security 
risk assessment was performed for each new service to account for the related risks.  The results of the risk 
assessment were reviewed and approved to ensure that risk treatment was carried out as necessary per the risk 
treatment plans.  The most recent information security risk assessment and risk treatment processes related to 
services relevant for the scope expansion took place between July 2021 and November 2021. 
 
A statement of applicability has been documented and lists the applicable controls from Annex A of ISO 27001, as 
well as any applicable ISO 27017, ISO 27018, and ISO 27701 controls that have been selected to mitigate risks as 
outlined in the risk assessment and risk treatment plan.  It also details the controls that have been explicitly excluded 
with a justification for such exclusion.  Per the statement of applicability, Microsoft does not outsource any 
development activities, and as a result, Annex A control A.14.2.7 was justified for exclusion. 
 
Schellman reviewed the risk assessment reports for a representative sample of services and offerings as part of 
scope expansion review and noted that the process for assessing risks was effective and in accordance with the 
requirements of the standard. 
 
 
ISMS Effectiveness Measurements (Clause 9.1) 
 
Microsoft Azure manages security key performance indicators (KPIs) to adequately measure security performance 
and effectiveness across the ISMS and PIMS.  Annual, independent entity managed assessments are conducted 
over the design and operating effectiveness of the control environment, which allow for the monitoring, 
measurement, analysis, and evaluation of the controls.  Monitoring is embedded in each service area supporting 
the ISMS and PIMS.   
 
Senior leadership reviews and amends the security KPIs and major milestones as part of the semester planning 
(greenlight meeting) process on a semi-annual basis.  KPIs are reviewed by management and action items are 
created and tracked via appropriate security metrics through the S360 portal. 
 
The monitoring, measurement, analysis, and evaluation process was noted to have been effectively implemented 
related to the additional services and offerings in accordance with the requirements of the standard. 
 
 
Internal ISMS Audits (Clause 9.2) 
 
Microsoft Azure management is committed to performing continuous independent reviews and assessments of its 
ISMS, PIMS, and control environment to ensure design and operating effectiveness of the controls is assessed and 
validated on periodic basis.  An independent internal audit was conducted surrounding the additional services and 
offerings as it pertained to the ISMS framework and applicable controls (including the ISO 27701 processor control 
activities).  The Schellman audit team reviewed the final version of internal audit report; the assessment was found 
to be effective.  
 
The internal audit efforts supporting the additional services and offerings were completed in December 2021 and 
were noted to be effectively implemented in accordance with the requirements of the standard. 
 
 
Management Reviews (Clause 9.3) 
 
Per the ISMS manual, quarterly leadership reviews are conducted to discuss progress, monitor changes, and 
provide input to the continuous improvement of information security and privacy KPIs relevant to the ISMS and 
PIMS.  The leadership review of security and privacy goals and objectives addresses internal / external topics 
related to monitoring, trend analysis and issue mitigation and ensures the continuing suitability, adequacy, and 
effectiveness of ISMS.  The inputs and outputs to ISMS management review along with the different types of reviews 
and their cadence are defined in the ISMS manual.   
 
Schellman reviewed the slides from the bi-annual planning review documentation as well as the meeting invitation 
and agenda from the August 19, 2021, meeting and determined that the management review process incorporated

the considerations of the additional services and offerings, and was effectively implemented in accordance with the 
requirements of the standard. 
 
 
Corrective Action and Continual Improvement (Clause 10) 
 
The requirements of Clause 10 (corrective action and continual improvement) are defined in the ISMS manual.  As 
the new offerings and services were already incorporated as a part of Microsoft Azure, the following aspects of the 
ISMS were unaffected by the scope expansion review: 
• 
Nonconformity and Corrective Action (Clause 10.1) 
•

Customer Agreement (8.2.1) 
In addition to contracts and scope of work documents, Microsoft maintains a data protection addendum (DPA) with 
each customer.  This DPA is also made available on Microsoft’s website.  The DPA includes references to security 
of processing and breach notification.  Microsoft’s DPA specifies that “Microsoft will implement and maintain 
appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Customer Data and Personal Data.  Those measures 
shall be set forth in a Microsoft Security Policy.  Microsoft will make that policy available to Customer, along with 
descriptions of the security controls in place for the Online Service and other information reasonably requested by 
Customer regarding Microsoft security practices and policies.  If Microsoft becomes aware of a breach of security 
leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to Customer 
Data or Personal Data while processed by Microsoft, Microsoft will promptly and without undue delay (1) notify 
Customer of the Security Incident.  Microsoft makes reasonable efforts to assist Customer in fulfilling Customer’s 
obligation under GDPR Article 33 or other applicable law or regulation to notify the relevant supervisory authority 
and data subjects about such Security Incident.  
 
Organization’s purposes (8.2.2) 
Microsoft’s contracts specify that it will process customer data only to provide agreed-upon services to its 
customers.  Specifically, when Microsoft acts as the processor or subprocessor of Personal Data, it will process 
Personal Data only on documented instructions from Customer.  Microsoft’s Trust Center webpage specifies that 
Microsoft will use customer data only to provide the services agreed upon and for purposes that are compatible 
with providing those services.  Microsoft also makes itself available to customer audits for customers to verify that 
data is only processed in accordance with the executed agreement.  Additionally, Microsoft conducts data protection 
impact assessments (DPIAs) for in-scope services, and in its DPIAs the organization notes that Microsoft is a 
processor and the basis for processing is documented instructions from the customer controller pursuant to the 
product terms. 
 
Marketing and advertising use (8.2.3) 
Microsoft’s contracts with its customers specify that Microsoft may not use the data that it processes for the 
purposes of marketing and advertising.  Microsoft agrees with customers not to use or otherwise process Customer 
Data or derive information from it for any advertising or similar commercial purposes.  Microsoft’s Trust Center 
webpage specifies Microsoft does not share customer data with Microsoft’s advertiser-supported services, nor does 
Microsoft mine it for marketing or advertising.  Additionally, Microsoft Azure’s DPIA guidance article issued to 
customers to help them decide whether or not they will need to perform a DPIA for their instance of Azure states 
that Microsoft will not use Customer Data or information derived from it for profiling or for advertising or similar 
commercial purposes.  Further, a DPIA for an example in-scope system indicates that, per the organization’s privacy 
review, customer data is not used for marketing purposes.

Infringing Instruction (8.2.4) 
Microsoft’s contracts with customers require it to inform the customer if, in its opinion, a processing instruction 
infringes on certain data protection laws or rules.  Microsoft’s DPA provides that Microsoft will immediately inform 
Customer if, in its opinion, an instruction infringes the GDPR or other Union or Member State data protection 
provisions.   
 
Customer obligations (8.2.5) 
Microsoft provides its customers with information to enable customers to demonstrate compliance with their 
obligations.  Microsoft’s DPA states that Microsoft will conduct audits of the security of the computers, computing 
environment and physical data centers that it uses in processing Customer Data and Personal Data.  If the customer 
requests, Microsoft will provide Customer with each Microsoft Audit Report.  Microsoft’s Trust Center provides 
visibility into how their enterprise cloud services are designed, developed, deployed, and managed.  Microsoft’s 
products and services are independently audited.   
  
Records related to processing PII (8.2.6) 
Microsoft maintains records in support of demonstrating compliance with its obligations for the processing of PII 
carried out on behalf of a customer.  Specifically, an example Data Protection Impact Assessment for Microsoft’s 
SaaS Power Platform details how Microsoft processes data on behalf of customers and the technical and 
organizational measures in place to safeguard PII.  Microsoft also makes available independent audit reports to its 
customers to help demonstrate compliance and the processing performed.  
 
 
Obligation to PII Principals (ISO 27701 Clause 8.3) 
 
Microsoft provides its customers with the means to comply with their obligations related to PII principals.  Consistent 
with the functionality of the services and Microsoft’s role as a data processor, Microsoft gives customers the ability 
to fulfill data subjects’ requests to exercise their rights under the GDPR and CCPA.  Microsoft maintains the 
Microsoft Security Policy, which lists the appropriate technical and organizational measures implemented to protect 
Professional Services Data.  Microsoft makes the security policy available to customers, along with other information 
reasonably requested by customers regarding Microsoft security practices and policies.  Microsoft also makes 
reports regarding privacy, security, and compliance related information for Microsoft’s cloud services available to 
its customers. 
 
Microsoft complies with reasonable requests by customers to assist with the customer’s response to data subject 
requests.  Microsoft provides a data subject request portal, which enables customers to fulfill GDPR and CCPA 
requests and shows them how to use Microsoft products, services, and administrative tools to find and act on 
personal data that resides in the Microsoft cloud.  In addition, Microsoft provides to its customers built-in controls, 
configuration management tools, and data subject request tools to assist customers in meeting their obligations to 
PII principals. 
 
 
Privacy by Design and Privacy by Default (ISO 27701 Clause 8.4) 
 
Temporary Files (8.4.1)  
Microsoft Azure has policies and practices to ensure that temporary files created as a result of the processing of PII 
are disposed of (e.g., erased or destroyed) following documented procedures within a specified, documented 
period.  Microsoft Azure’s Legal and Regulatory Compliance Standard Operating Procedures states, “Temporary 
files and documents are erased or destroyed within a specified, documented period.” The organization has an 
automated script that runs to remove temp files at the end of a 90 day period. 
 
Return, Transfer or Disposal of PII (8.4.2)  
Microsoft provides the ability to return, transfer and dispose of PII in a secure manner.  Customers (i.e., data 
controllers) may access a portal to action data subject rights requests, including requests to delete and export 
personal data.  Microsoft also provides an import/export service to assist with transfer and return of PII information 
on a larger scale.

PII Transmission Controls (8.4.3)  
Microsoft Azure secures data transmitted over a data-transmission network via controls designed to ensure that the 
data reaches its intended destination.  Microsoft Azure offers both transport layer security (TLS) and Perfect 
Forward Secrecy (PFS) as mechanisms for keeping data private as it moves locations.  For interacting with Microsoft 
Azure Storage through the Azure portal, data in transit is encrypted via https.  
 
 
PII Sharing, Transfer, and Disclosure (ISO 27701 Clause 8.5) 
 
Basis for PII Transfer Between Jurisdictions (8.5.1) 
Microsoft informs customers via its Online Service Terms of the basis of data transfers between certain jurisdictions.  
Specifically, the Online Service Terms provide as follows:  
• 
Customer Data and Personal Data that Microsoft processes on Customer’s behalf may be transferred to, 
and stored and processed in, the United States or any other country in which Microsoft or its Subprocessors 
operate.  Customer appoints Microsoft to perform any such transfer of Customer Data and Personal Data 
to any such country and to store and process Customer Data and Personal Data to provide the Online 
Services. 
• 
Microsoft will abide by the requirements of European Economic Area and Swiss data protection law 
regarding the collection, use, transfer, retention, and other processing of Personal Data from the European 
Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland.  All transfers of Personal Data to a third country or an international 
organization will be subject to appropriate safeguards as described in Article 46 of the GDPR and such 
transfers and safeguards will be documented according to Article 30(2) of the GDPR.  Transfers of customer 
data and personal data out of the European Union, EEA, United Kingdom, and Switzerland are governed 
by standard contractual clauses implemented by Microsoft.  
 
Countries and International Organizations to which PII can be Transferred (8.5.2)  
Microsoft Azure documents the countries and organizations to which data can be transferred.  Microsoft’s Azure’s 
Data Protection Impact Assessments include data flow diagrams that illustrate the countries and regions to which 
data may be transferred.  Microsoft Azure also maintains a list of all subprocessors, which indicates the service 
each subprocessor provides and its corporate location.    
 
Records of PII Disclosures to Third Parties (8.5.3) 
Microsoft tracks and records disclosures of PII to third parties or provides customers with the ability to do the same.  
Microsoft Azure records the categories of third parties to whom information may be disclosed and provides a list of 
subprocessors, including the services each provides.  In addition, Microsoft’s Data Protection Addendum provides 
that Microsoft tracks, or enables Customer to track, disclosures of Customer Data, including what data has been 
disclosed, to whom, and at what time. 
 
Notification of PII Disclosure Requests (8.5.4)  
Microsoft Azure’s Data Protection Addendum (DPA) requires it to notify the customer of any legally binding requests 
for disclosure of information.  Specifically, the DPA provides that Microsoft will not disclose Customer Data or 
Personal Data to law enforcement unless required by law.  If law enforcement contacts Microsoft with a demand for 
Customer Data or Personal Data, Microsoft will attempt to redirect the law enforcement agency to request that data 
directly from Customer.  If compelled to disclose Customer Data or Personal Data to law enforcement, Microsoft 
will promptly notify Customer and provide a copy of the demand unless legally prohibited from doing so.  Upon 
receipt of any other third-party request for Customer Data or Personal Data, Microsoft will promptly notify Customer 
unless prohibited by law.  Microsoft will reject the request unless required by law to comply.  If the request is valid, 
Microsoft will attempt to redirect the third party to request the data directly from Customer.   
 
Additionally, in a public facing document concerning its stance on notification of requests from law enforcement, 
Microsoft commits to giving prior notice to its enterprise customers of any third-party request for their data, except 
where prohibited by law.

Legally Binding PII Disclosures (8.5.5)  
Microsoft Azure’s DPA requires Microsoft to reject any requests for customer data that are not legally binding.  
Specifically, the DPA provides, “Microsoft will reject the request unless required by law to comply.” (p. 8) Requests 
are reviewed by relevant teams and if found to be legally binding, are reviewed against applicable laws and 
regulations for notification requirements to impacted customers. 
 
Disclosure of Subcontractors Used to Process PII (8.5.6) 
Microsoft Azure discloses its use of subcontractors to process customer data to customer via a customer portal.  
Microsoft’s DPA provides that, “Microsoft makes available information about Subprocessors on a Microsoft website.”  
Microsoft’s website includes a complete list of the subcontractors it engages and their corporate locations.  Microsoft 
also allows customers to subscribe to a notification list to receive notification whenever the listing of subcontractors 
is updated. 
 
Engagement of Subcontractors to Process PII (8.5.7) 
Microsoft’s DPA provides the process for engaging subcontractors.  Specifically, when engaging any Subprocessor, 
Microsoft will ensure via a written contract that the Subprocessor may access and use Customer Data or Personal 
Data only to deliver the services Microsoft has retained them to provide and is prohibited from using Customer Data 
or Personal Data for any other purpose.  Microsoft will ensure that Subprocessors are bound by written agreements 
that require them to provide at least the level of data protection required of Microsoft by the DPA.  Further, the 
DPA’s European Union General Data Protection Regulation Terms Attachment (Attachment 2) provides, Microsoft 
shall not engage another processor without prior specific or general written authorization of Customer.  In the case 
of general written authorization, Microsoft shall inform Customer of any intended changes concerning the addition 
or replacement of other processors, thereby giving Customer the opportunity to object to such changes. 
 
Microsoft Azure has a written contract with its subcontractors addressing implementation of controls with respect to 
processing PII.  Microsoft’s Master Supplier Services Agreement provides that subprocessors will:  
• 
Process the Personal Data only on documented instructions from Microsoft; 
• 
Ensure that persons authorized to Process the Personal Data have committed themselves to confidentiality 
or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality; and 
• 
Take all measures required in accordance with good industry practice and by Data Protection Law related 
to data security.  
 
Change of Subcontractor to Process PII (8.5.8) 
Microsoft provides notice to customers of new subprocessors.  Microsoft’s DPA provides that Microsoft may engage 
new Subprocessors.  Microsoft will give Customer notice (by updating the website and provide Customer with a 
mechanism to obtain notice of that update) of any new Subprocessor at least 6 months in advance of providing that 
Subprocessor with access to Customer Data.  Additionally, Microsoft will give Customer notice (by updating the 
website and providing Customer with a mechanism to obtain notice of that update) of any Subprocessor at least 30 
days in advance of providing that Subprocessor with access to Professional Services Data or Personal Data other 
than that which is contained in Customer Data.

FINDINGS OF NONCONFORMITY AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR 
IMPROVEMENT 
 
Description of Findings (Major and Minor Nonconformities and Opportunities for Improvement) 
 
There were no nonconformities or OFIs noted as a result of the 2021 scope expansion review.  Note that 
documentation and evidence was reviewed for content supporting the addition of services per the objectives of the 
scope modification review.  
 
 
Explanation of ISO Requirement Classifications 
 
This report provides management with an identification of the documentation efforts, in addition to the review and 
testing of the maintenance, monitoring, and operating effectiveness of the ISMS in relation to the ISO 27001 
standard requirements, specifically Clauses 4 through 10 and the control activities identified within Annex A, ISO 
27017, ISO 27018, and ISO 27701, that are applicable to the ISMS.  In addition, this report provides management 
with an identification of the documentation efforts, in addition to the review and testing of the maintenance, 
monitoring, and operating effectiveness of the PIMS in relation to the ISO 27701 standard requirements, specifically 
Clauses 5 through 8 and the control activities identified within Annex B that are applicable to the PIMS.  
Documentation requirements as well as the maintenance, monitoring, and operating effectiveness of the ISMS have 
been classified according to their significance in achieving conformance to the standard.  The classifications are 
defined as follows: 
• 
Conform (C) – Based on observations, discussions with personnel, and inspection testing, these 
documentation requirements and/or controls are currently in place and found to be operating effectively. 
• 
Nonconformities (Major (MJ) and Minor (MN)) 
Per definition from ISO 17021-1, a nonconformity is a nonfulfillment of the requirement.  Major and Minor 
Nonconformity definitions are included below: 
o 
Major: nonconformity that affects the capability of the management system to achieve the 
intended results 
Note 1 to entry: Nonconformities could be classified as major in the following circumstances: 1) if 
there is a significant doubt that effective process control is in place, or that products or services will 
meet specified requirements, or 2) a number of minor nonconformities associated with the same 
requirement or issue could demonstrate a systemic failure and thus constitute a major 
nonconformity. 
o 
Minor: nonconformity that does not affect the capability of the management system to 
achieve the intended results 
• 
Not Applicable (NA) – Clause or control of the ISO 27001 standard was not applicable to the review 
performed.
