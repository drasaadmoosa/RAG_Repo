EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
Introduction 
 
Microsoft underwent a CSA STAR recertification review in October 2025 of their ISO/IEC 27001:2022 (ISO 27001) 
ISMS.  The purpose of the CSA STAR recertification review was to reassess the ISMS against the CSA STAR 
Certification program requirements.  The CSA STAR Certification is a third-party independent assessment of the 
security of a cloud service provider (CSP) that leverages the requirements of the ISO 27001 management system 
standard together with the CSA Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM) version 4.  The assessment included an evaluation 
of Microsoft’s maturity level across each CCM security domain.  The maturity level for each CCM security control 
and overall domain was assessed a score of 1 to 15 using the following table*.

The maturity score for each applicable domain was based on the lowest individual control score.  The composite 
maturity score was the average maturity score across all domains.  Note that per CSA STAR Certification guidelines, 
if a major nonconformity were noted in a control domain, the maximum possible maturity score would be 6; if a 
minor nonconformity was noted in a control domain, the maximum possible maturity score would be 9.  Based on 
the overall maturity score, an organization could achieve either no award, a bronze award, a silver award, or a gold 
award based on the following table.

Performance of the ISMS and PIMS Over the Certification Cycle 
 
Overall, Microsoft continued to demonstrate a sound understanding of its ISMS and PIMS as it continued to meet 
the requirements of the ISO 27001 standard and ISO 27701 standard, in addition to the control requirements 
included in the ISMS and based on the control sets within ISO 27017 and ISO 27018.  During the recertification 
review, an assessment was performed to determine the overall effectiveness of the ISMS and PIMS during the 
certification lifecycle and no negative trends were identified.  The ISMS and PIMS and control framework are 
established, have been supported by top management, and are supported by a competent team dedicated to the 
foundation and maintenance of the management system.  Since the 2025 scope expansion review, Microsoft 
continued to expand their ISMS and PIMS scope to include additional service offerings and data center locations 
and did so in continued conformance of the ISO 27001 and ISO 27701 standards and with regard to achieving the 
objectives of Microsoft’s information security and privacy policy and Microsoft’s maintenance, monitoring, and 
improvement activities of the ISMS and PIMS.  These changes were noted to have been reviewed and discussed 
by management, as appropriate, and appropriately included within the organization’s risk assessment and treatment 
process, internal audit, and supporting ISMS and PIMS policies and procedures. 
 
Microsoft has implemented continual improvement activities since the 2025 scope expansion review based on 
results from its risk assessments and implementation of risk treatment plans that were based on available or planned 
resources that took into consideration external and internal factors such as new organizational changes and 
location-specific regulations.  As part of the recertification review, evidence of improvement was reviewed and 
accepted by Schellman to close out the three open OFIs.  Additionally, there have been no complaints and Microsoft 
has properly marketed their certificate, including certification marks, in accordance with the client obligations and 
marketing guidelines provided to Microsoft and has not improperly used the registered trademark ISO logo or made 
improper references to ISO.  Lastly, as a part of the ISMS and PIMS, Microsoft has procedures in place to effectively 
monitor compliance with relevant information security and privacy legislation and regulations.

Clause 
ISMS and PIMS Review 
Policy (Clause 5.2) 
The IMF is responsible for establishing information security and privacy policies that are in 
alignment with organizational purposes and providing a framework for setting information 
security and privacy objectives.  The information security policies include commitments: 
• 
To satisfy applicable requirements for information security and privacy 
• 
To continually improve the ISMS and PIMS 
 
Microsoft’s information security and privacy policies and procedures have been developed in 
alignment with the standards to meet Microsoft’s compliance obligations.  The information 
security and privacy policies establish the foundation for IT, security, and privacy stakeholders 
to help support appropriate and authorized access, usage, and integrity of information.  The ISO 
27001 Annex A controls in addition to the control requirements included in the ISMS based on 
the control sets within the ISO 27017 and ISO 27018, and the PIMS processor requirements of 
ISO 27701 serve as the Microsoft standard as well as additional industry controls to meet 
additional regulatory requirements.  Microsoft’s information security and privacy policies are 
documented, communicated to the Microsoft workforce, and available to interested parties, as 
appropriate. 
Organizational Roles, 
Responsibilities, and 
Authorities (Clause 5.3) 
Microsoft top / senior management ensures responsibilities and authorities for roles relevant to 
information security and privacy are assigned and communicated.  The sponsorship of the 
ISMS and PIMS is headed by the IMF.  The IMF is the management group that oversees the 
various components of the ISMS and PIMS and the communication and exchange of 
information between those components.  The objective of the IMF is to ensure the operating 
effectiveness and continual improvement of the ISMS and PIMS. 
 
Organizational charts are in place that define the organizational structure, reporting lines, and 
authorities.  These charts are communicated to employees and updated as needed.  Relevant 
roles (e.g. top management, deputy, risk manager, and security, privacy, and quality 
compliance leads), their descriptions, and assignees are documented within the IMS plan. 
Planning (Clause 6 from ISO 27001 and Clause 5 from ISO 27701) 
Actions to Address Risks 
and Opportunities 
(Clause 6.1) 
Microsoft’s leadership team created the enterprise risk management (ERM) team to identify and 
ensure accountability of the company’s most significant risks.  The ERM is structured using a 
framework based on the COSO (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission) – enterprise risk management integrated framework.  It also aligns with the ISO 
31000:2009 risk management standard.  Microsoft’s risk assessment process allows the 
organization to assess, identify, and modify their overall security posture and to enable security, 
operations, organizational management, and other personnel to collaborate and view the entire 
organization from a vulnerability perspective.  The risk assessment process has obtained 
management’s commitment for the allocation of resources and for the implementation of 
appropriate security solutions to achieve the intended outcomes of the ISMS and PIMS, 
including preventing and mitigating undesired consequences, and continually improving. 
 
Microsoft’s process of identifying and assessing risks is a continuous and integrated process, 
which is integrated into the ongoing management cycles of each service team.  The ERM, 
working in conjunction with the Azure risk management team, analyzes risk registers throughout 
the year, which are completed at least semi-annually (April and October updates), or when 
significant events occur.  Risk treatment activities are monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure 
risks are addressed and treatment plans are successfully executed. 
 
The risk assessment results are collected and maintained within the risk manager system 
where they are then used to generate ERM reports. 
 
Additionally, every Microsoft Azure service and component completes a regular privacy review 
to identify potential privacy risks associated with the processing of PII.  The frequency of privacy 
reviews is based on risk level and the state of the service.  Further, the Azure Developer Tools 
and Services DPIA includes details about the service and a baseline review including a 
description of the processing, categories of data subjects, the data lifecycle, the measures or 
controls that were implemented to contribute to the rights of PII principals, and identification of 
privacy risks to individuals.

Physical Environment 
 
Microsoft: Azure, Dynamics, and other Online Services are hosted in datacenters located throughout the world, 
which are managed by Azure’s Physical Infrastructure team.  The Physical Infrastructure team provides the physical 
and logical infrastructure for Microsoft’s cloud and hosted applications.  The Physical Infrastructure team serves as 
the underlying platform that supports Microsoft’s software plus service strategy.  The physical infrastructure includes 
the datacenter facilities, as well as the hardware and software components that support the services and networks.  
At Microsoft, the logical infrastructure consists of operating system instances, routed networks, and unstructured 
data storage, whether running on virtual or physical assets.  Platform services include compute runtimes, identity, 
and directory stores (such as Active Directory® and Microsoft account), and other advanced functions consumed 
by Microsoft properties. 
 
Locations in-scope of the IMS 
Azure production infrastructure is located in globally distributed datacenters.  These datacenters deliver the core 
physical infrastructure that includes physical hardware asset management, security, data protection, networking 
services.  These datacenters are managed, monitored, and operated by Microsoft operations staff delivering online 
services with 24x7 continuity.  The purpose-built facilities are part of a network of datacenters that provide mission 
critical services to Azure and other Online Services.  The datacenters within scope of the IMS are as follows:
