AUDIT TEAM RECOMMENDATION, AUDIT FINDINGS, AND GENERAL 
DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ISMS AND PIMS 
 
Summary of Findings and Recommendation, General Design and Operating Effectiveness of the Client 
ISMS and PIMS 
 
Overall, the ISMS appears to be operating effectively and the client has met the requirements of the ISO 27001 
standard, in addition to the control requirements included in the ISMS and based on the control sets within ISO 
27017 and ISO 27018, and the PIMS requirements of ISO 27701 in the role of a personally identifiable information 
(PII) processor.  There were no nonconformities or opportunities for improvement (OFIs) noted as a result of the 
2025 recertification review.  It is the audit team’s recommendation to issue the certification for a three-year term 
reflecting the updated ISMS and PIMS scope based on modifications made since the 2025 scope expansion review. 
  
The ISMS and PIMS have adapted and demonstrated maturity over time, with the support of senior leadership, who 
have provided resources necessary to maintain and implement risk treatment plans and project initiatives designed 
to improve the risk posture of the organization.  Policies are well-defined, detailed, reviewed and updated regularly, 
communicated, and understood by users within the organization.  The policies and procedures are designed in 
accordance with the ISO 27001 standard in addition to the control requirements included in the ISMS based on the 
control sets within the ISO 27017 and ISO 27018, and the ISO 27701 standard for a PIMS, as a PII processor.   
 
The ISMS and PIMS have demonstrated improvement through ongoing monitoring activities, such as the risk 
assessments and management reviews, which have identified areas for management to address risk or improve 
the company’s risk posture via implementation of new security programs and initiatives, the addition of security and 
compliance personnel to ensure that the ISMS and PIMS operate as intended, and implementation of new security 
tools and processes designed to manage risk, both manual and automated.  These plans were implemented through 
the support of planned resources made available by senior leadership, taking into consideration the needs and 
requirements of interested parties, and driven by external and internal factors such as organizational changes, new 
business opportunities, updates to regulation and legislation, and newly identified security risks. 
  
As part of the assessment, Schellman concluded that the scope of the ISMS and PIMS was appropriate, and the 
audit objectives of the review were met.

Performance of the ISMS and PIMS Over the Certification Cycle 
 
Overall, Microsoft continued to demonstrate a sound understanding of its ISMS and PIMS as it continued to meet 
the requirements of the ISO 27001 standard and ISO 27701 standard, in addition to the control requirements 
included in the ISMS and based on the control sets within ISO 27017 and ISO 27018.  During the recertification 
review, an assessment was performed to determine the overall effectiveness of the ISMS and PIMS during the 
certification lifecycle and no negative trends were identified.  The ISMS and PIMS and control framework are 
established, have been supported by top management, and are supported by a competent team dedicated to the 
foundation and maintenance of the management system.  Since the 2025 scope expansion review, Microsoft 
continued to expand their ISMS and PIMS scope to include additional service offerings and data center locations 
and did so in continued conformance of the ISO 27001 and ISO 27701 standards and with regard to achieving the 
objectives of Microsoft’s information security and privacy policy and Microsoft’s maintenance, monitoring, and 
improvement activities of the ISMS and PIMS.  These changes were noted to have been reviewed and discussed 
by management, as appropriate, and appropriately included within the organization’s risk assessment and treatment 
process, internal audit, and supporting ISMS and PIMS policies and procedures. 
 
Microsoft has implemented continual improvement activities since the 2025 scope expansion review based on 
results from its risk assessments and implementation of risk treatment plans that were based on available or planned 
resources that took into consideration external and internal factors such as new organizational changes and 
location-specific regulations.  As part of the recertification review, evidence of improvement was reviewed and 
accepted by Schellman to close out the three open OFIs.  Additionally, there have been no complaints and Microsoft 
has properly marketed their certificate, including certification marks, in accordance with the client obligations and 
marketing guidelines provided to Microsoft and has not improperly used the registered trademark ISO logo or made 
improper references to ISO.  Lastly, as a part of the ISMS and PIMS, Microsoft has procedures in place to effectively 
monitor compliance with relevant information security and privacy legislation and regulations.

Information Security 
Management System 
(Clause 4.4) 
Microsoft has established an integrated management system (IMS) scope statement which 
serves as a framework to lead the implementation, maintenance, and continual improvement 
of the ISMS and PIMS in accordance with the requirements of the standards.  Such activities 
are demonstrated through its establishment of the IMF, which encompasses a select group of 
Microsoft’s department heads to integrate information security and privacy considerations into 
its day-to-day activities, fostering an environment of continual improvement. 
Leadership (Clauses 5) 
Leadership and 
Commitment (Clause 5.1) 
The Microsoft Azure, Dynamics, and other Online Services leadership team provides 
governance for Microsoft Azure and is represented by the top management (corporate vice 
president (VP) and partner directors of the feature teams).  An organizational chart of the 
team with roles and responsibilities is well defined and included in the IMS scope statement 
and information security and privacy manual.  Microsoft Azure leadership is committed to lead 
and strategically align the ISMS and PIMS to meet business goals and objectives. 
Policy (Clause 5.2) 
The IMF is responsible for establishing information security and privacy policies that are in 
alignment with organizational purposes and providing a framework for setting information 
security and privacy objectives.  The information security policies include commitments: 
• 
To satisfy applicable requirements for information security and privacy 
• 
To continually improve the ISMS and PIMS 
 
Microsoft’s information security and privacy policies and procedures have been developed in 
alignment with the standards to meet Microsoft’s compliance obligations.  The information 
security and privacy policies establish the foundation for IT, security, and privacy 
stakeholders to help support appropriate and authorized access, usage, and integrity of 
information.  The ISO 27001 Annex A controls in addition to the control requirements included 
in the ISMS based on the control sets within the ISO 27017 and ISO 27018, and the PIMS 
processor requirements of ISO 27701 serve as the Microsoft standard as well as additional 
industry controls to meet additional regulatory requirements.  Microsoft’s information security 
and privacy policies are documented, communicated to the Microsoft workforce, and 
available to interested parties, as appropriate. 
Organizational Roles, 
Responsibilities, and 
Authorities (Clause 5.3) 
Microsoft top / senior management ensures responsibilities and authorities for roles relevant 
to information security and privacy are assigned and communicated.  The sponsorship of the 
ISMS and PIMS is headed by the IMF.  The IMF is the management group that oversees the 
various components of the ISMS and PIMS and the communication and exchange of 
information between those components.  The objective of the IMF is to ensure the operating 
effectiveness and continual improvement of the ISMS and PIMS. 
 
Organizational charts are in place that define the organizational structure, reporting lines, and 
authorities.  These charts are communicated to employees and updated as needed.

Clause 
ISMS and PIMS Review 
Relevant roles (e.g., top management, deputy, risk manager, and security, privacy, and 
quality compliance leads), their descriptions, and assignees are documented within the IMS 
plan. 
Planning (Clause 6 from ISO 27001 and Clause 5 from ISO 27701) 
Actions to Address Risks 
and Opportunities (Clause 
6.1) 
Microsoft’s leadership team created the enterprise risk management (ERM) team to identify 
and ensure accountability of the company’s most significant risks.  The ERM is structured 
using a framework based on the COSO (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the 
Treadway Commission) – enterprise risk management integrated framework.  It also aligns 
with the ISO 31000:2009 risk management standard.  Microsoft’s risk assessment process 
allows the organization to assess, identify, and modify their overall security posture and to 
enable security, operations, organizational management, and other personnel to collaborate 
and view the entire organization from a vulnerability perspective.  The risk assessment 
process has obtained management’s commitment for the allocation of resources and for the 
implementation of appropriate security solutions to achieve the intended outcomes of the 
ISMS and PIMS, including preventing and mitigating undesired consequences, and 
continually improving. 
 
Microsoft’s process of identifying and assessing risks is a continuous and integrated process, 
which is integrated into the ongoing management cycles of each service team.  The ERM, 
working in conjunction with the Azure risk management team, analyzes risk registers 
throughout the year, which are completed at least semi-annually (April and October updates), 
or when significant events occur.  Risk treatment activities are monitored on an ongoing basis 
to ensure risks are addressed and treatment plans are successfully executed. 
 
The risk assessment results are collected and maintained within the risk manager system 
where they are then used to generate ERM reports. 
 
Additionally, every Microsoft Azure service and component completes a regular privacy 
review to identify potential privacy risks associated with the processing of PII.  The frequency 
of privacy reviews is based on risk level and the state of the service.  Further, the Azure 
Developer Tools and Services DPIA includes details about the service and a baseline review 
including a description of the processing, categories of data subjects, the data lifecycle, the 
measures or controls that were implemented to contribute to the rights of PII principals, and 
identification of privacy risks to individuals. 
Statement of Applicability 
(Clause 6.1.3) 
A statement of applicability, version 2025.02, has been documented and lists the applicable 
controls from Annex A of ISO 27001 and Annex B of ISO 27701, as well as applicable ISO 
27017 and ISO 27018 controls that have been selected to mitigate risks as outlined in the risk 
assessment and risk treatment plan. 
Information Security 
Objectives and Planning to 
Achieve Them (Clause 6.2) 
Microsoft has established security and privacy objectives at appropriate and relevant 
functions and levels to provide a platform to improve security, privacy, delivery, corrective 
action response, and other metrics to achieve desired performance levels for Microsoft cloud 
products and services.  The plan to satisfy the information security and privacy objectives are 
referenced in the IMS manual. 
 
Information security and privacy objectives are tracked and monitored closely by responsible 
departmental teams and reported to the IMF, as necessary.  A summary of current 
information security and privacy objectives and their performance is also reported and 
reviewed as part of the monthly security leadership meetings, which includes a review of 
information security and privacy objective effectiveness and adequacy. 
Planning of Changes 
(Clause 6.3) 
Changes to the ISMS and PIMS are carried out in a planned manner and discussed as a 
component of various management meetings, such as the semi-annual semester planning 
meetings, monthly cloud, and artificial intelligence (CAI) leadership meetings, periodic 
compliance, and privacy reviews, etc. 
Support (Clause 7) 
Resources (Clause 7.1) 
Microsoft management is committed to continual improvement and effectiveness of the ISMS 
and PIMS.  Periodic reviews are scheduled to allocate appropriate budget to meet operational 
requirements and implement corresponding action for the risk treatment plans.  Through the

campaigns, software for targeting requirements, and information operations and kinetic 
effects (STRIKE) role-based training is available to FTEs and contingent staff, as necessary.  
New hires are required to take mandatory training before accessing organizational systems or 
performing assigned duties.  Suppliers are required to complete the supplier code of conduct 
training upon hire.  A security education and awareness standard operating procedure (SOP) 
is in place to provide guidance and direction on the security and awareness training process.  
For security and compliance training programs that are delivered to groups outside the 
organization, the organization partners with education solutions like the My Learning system. 
 
Competence and awareness are also accounted for as part of the internal audit process, 
which defines that internal auditors providing internal audit services to Microsoft are subject to 
review and approval based on competency requirements set forth by Microsoft. 
Communication (Clause 
7.4) 
Microsoft management is committed to proper communication with the internal and external 
stakeholders regarding the state of the ISMS and PIMS.  The internal and external 
stakeholders have been defined and appropriate decisions are made as to who needs to 
receive what level of detail and when.  A formal communication plan has been established 
and documented within the Microsoft IMS communication plan.  The IMS communication plan 
is reviewed at least annually or as needed for appropriateness. 
Documented Information 
(Clause 7.5) 
As noted in the document and record management SOP, Microsoft has defined procedures to 
ensure the control over creation, approval, distribution, usage, and updates of documents and 
records used in the ISMS and PIMS.  The SOP is applied to documents and records related 
to the ISMS and PIMS, regardless of whether the documents and records were created 
internally or whether they are of external origin.  The policy encompasses documents and 
records stored in any format (e.g., paper, audio, video, etc.). 
 
Documents are reviewed and approved at least annually or upon significant change.  
Documents are updated by the control owners / service team subject matter experts (SMEs) 
and approved by the compliance lead prior to publication.  The change history of the 
document tracks any changes to the content, including creation date, version number, author, 
change description, approver, and approval date.  When documents are no longer required, 
they are disposed of according to secure disposal practices. 
Operation (Clause 8) 
Operational Planning and 
Control, Information 
Security Risk Assessment, 
and Information Security 
Risk Treatment (Clause 8) 
The most recent information security risk assessment and risk treatment processes took 
place during Microsoft’s 2025 fiscal year.  The results of the risk assessment and the status 
of risk treatment plans were reviewed as a component of the semi-annual enterprise risk 
discussion.  Additionally, as a component of the risk assessment and risk treatment process, 
it was noted that Microsoft’s statement of applicability contained references to the related 
risks in the risk register for each in-scope control.   
Performance Evaluation (Clause 9) 
Monitoring, Measurement, 
Analysis, and Evaluation 
(Clause 9.1) 
Effectiveness measurement of the ISMS and PIMS is to help ensure continued adequacy, 
effectiveness, and efficiency of the program.  In addition, Microsoft Azure manages security 
and privacy KPIs to adequately measure security and privacy performance and effectiveness 
across the ISMS and PIMS.  Annual, independent entity managed assessments are 
conducted over the design and operating effectiveness of the control environment, which 
allow for the monitoring, measurement, analysis, and evaluation of the controls.  Monitoring is 
embedded in each service area supporting the ISMS and PIMS. 
 
Measurement initiatives were conducted on a regular basis at varied frequencies, depending 
on the metric being monitored.  Achieved metrics were formally communicated and reviewed 
as a component of the June 2025 greenlight planning meeting, as well as the April 2025 
compliance and privacy review meeting.  The compliance and review meeting included a

Clause 
ISMS and PIMS Review 
review of the various audit and compliance programs, as well as status of the ongoing 
internal programs. 
Internal Audit (Clause 9.2) 
Microsoft Azure management is committed to performing continuous independent reviews 
and assessments of its ISMS, PIMS, and control environment to ensure design and operating 
effectiveness of the controls is assessed and validated on periodic basis.  Microsoft 
undergoes several independent internal / external entities managed assessments.  The 
compliance team coordinates and facilitates the independent attestations and reviews.  
 
The most recent internal audit of the IMS was performed by an independent third party.  The 
internal audit report was dated June 2025, and covers the conformance of the ISMS and 
PIMS to the requirements of the following ISO standards: ISO 27001, ISO 27017, ISO 27018, 
and ISO 27701.  The internal audit report included an overall conclusion, audit objectives, 
scope, audit criteria (inclusive of frequency and methods), assessment of areas reviewed, as 
well as detailed audit results to support the audit conclusion.  The internal audit report was 
provided to management in June 2025. 
 
Note that informal internal audits occur as needed when onboarding new services and 
offerings as well as when performing unique assessments on modifications to the 
management system (i.e., update to the 2025 version of ISO 27018). 
Management Review 
(Clause 9.3) 
Periodic management reviews of the ISMS and PIMS are performed, ensuring continuing 
suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness of the management systems.  The IMF’s role is to 
provide management oversight and guidance on the business operations and effectiveness of 
the ISMS and PIMS via periodic meetings. 
 
The most recent monthly CAI leadership review meeting was held on September 23, 2025.  
Minutes were taken during the meeting and maintained as records.  The minutes included the 
agenda items, the associated action items, and future management review meeting topics to 
be discussed. 
Improvement (Clause 10) 
Continual Improvement 
(Clause 10.1) and 
Nonconformity and 
Corrective Action (Clause 
10.2) 
Continuous improvement is inherent in the supporting processes and activities of Microsoft’s 
ISMS and PIMS.  Continuous improvement was supported through the most recent risk 
assessment, review of information security and privacy objectives, results from the most 
recent internal audit, and outputs from the monthly security leadership meetings.  
 
Microsoft management takes corrective action, as necessary, to eliminate the cause of 
nonconformities within the scope of the ISMS and PIMS.  Procedures are followed when 
taking corrective action and actions are recorded in the Microsoft Azure exception trackers.  
Depending on the nature and severity of the nonconformity, the records of corrective actions 
are reviewed by management during Microsoft Azure risk management forum.

Physical Environment 
 
Microsoft: Azure, Dynamics, and other Online Services are hosted in datacenters located throughout the world, 
which are managed by Azure’s Physical Infrastructure team.  The Physical Infrastructure team provides the physical 
and logical infrastructure for Microsoft’s cloud and hosted applications.  The Physical Infrastructure team serves as 
the underlying platform that supports Microsoft’s software plus service strategy.  The physical infrastructure includes 
the datacenter facilities, as well as the hardware and software components that support the services and networks.  
At Microsoft, the logical infrastructure consists of operating system instances, routed networks, and unstructured 
data storage, whether running on virtual or physical assets.  Platform services include compute runtimes, identity, 
and directory stores (such as Active Directory® and Microsoft account), and other advanced functions consumed 
by Microsoft properties. 
 
Locations in-scope of the IMS 
Azure production infrastructure is located in globally distributed datacenters.  These datacenters deliver the core 
physical infrastructure that includes physical hardware asset management, security, data protection, networking 
services.  These datacenters are managed, monitored, and operated by Microsoft operations staff delivering online 
services with 24x7 continuity.  The purpose-built facilities are part of a network of datacenters that provide mission 
critical services to Azure and other Online Services.  The datacenters within scope of the IMS are as follows:
