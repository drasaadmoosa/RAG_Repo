Executive Summary 
 
This was an annual surveillance audit to verify continued compliance to multiple standards including ISO 
27001:2013, ISO 27701:2021, ISO 27018:2020, ISO 27017:2021, ISO 22301:2019, and ISO 27001:2022. 
 
Microsoft 365 has successfully maintained their management system to high standards. 
During the audit, samples of evidence were taken from different service line offerings, and all observed to 
be of a mature nature with no NC's identified as part of this audit. The management system is part of their 
daily operating practices, and this was evident from speaking with various staff members as part of the 
interviews and reviewing objective evidence presented. Industry best practices were observed throughout 
the audit with staff having a clear understanding of the ISO requirements from all standards as part of their 
daily tasks. 
 
This audit certifies the processes that govern Microsoft 365 (M365) services and support features, which 
can be purchased in a variety of combinations by customers. For a detailed list of the services in scope, 
they are outlined in the Microsoft Product Terms for Online Services. 
The certificates for M365 (all ISO/IEC 27001, 27017, 27018, 27701 and 22301) are in accordance with the 
requirements of the activities within the ISMS, PIMS and BCMS. 
 
The report is issued to the entity/client Microsoft Corporation from the corporate headquarters of One 
Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 90852. 
 
Although the M365 services are available worldwide, management of all services included in the scope of 
M365’s ISO Certificates are centralized across a standard set of technology, processes, and requirements. 
While the ISO Audit takes place at the Microsoft corporate headquarters, because of how the M365 services 
are maintained, all worldwide locations of M365 are included. 
Licenses of M365 sold by certified partners including Microsoft affiliates and subsidiaries outside the USA, 
are serviced by Microsoft Corporation performing contractual obligations. Those commitments are 
implemented via the ISMS that is operated by the certified entity. 
 
The ISO standards require an audit, which includes a requirement for vulnerability assessment and 
remediation of issues by the operators of the ISMS under test in this assessment. Additionally, Microsoft has 
a published policy for customer performance of vulnerability assessment. Such testing can be used by 
Customers to further assess vulnerability risk in M365 under the Microsoft Cloud Penetration Testing Rules 
of Engagement.

Assessment objective, scope, and criteria 
The objective of the assessment was to conduct a surveillance assessment and look for positive evidence to 
ensure that elements of the scope of certification and the requirements of the management standard are 
effectively addressed by the organization's management system and that the system is demonstrating the 
ability to support the achievement of statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements and the 
organization's specified objectives, as applicable with regard to the scope of the management standard, and 
to confirm the on-going achievement and applicability of the forward strategic plan and where applicable to 
identify potential areas for improvement of the management system. 
 
The scope of the assessment was defined in the plan provided in terms of locations and areas of the system 
and organization to be assessed. 
 
The criteria of the assessment was ISO 27001, 27701, 27017, 27018, and 22301 and Microsoft's 
management system documentation. 
 
Statutory and regulatory requirements

Compliance Lifecycle is a federated effort, and this is all done basically as where the M365 is governed by 
the Overall Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) for Microsoft. 
 
Risk Program Objectives 
Identify, Assess, manage, ensure accessibility, and aligns with the ERM, in addition they identify security, 
privacy and compliance risk. 
 
MS 365 Risk Flow 
-Inputs - M365 Teams, Security, Trust, and Risk Committee all feed into the ERM which then reports to 
Senior Leadership and the BOD. All risks raised by product teams go to risk committees. Risk is identified, 
assessed, developed treatment plan, report to management, and then are monitored. New risks are added 
to AZURE Devops to track risks within their ADO. 
Risks are identified via pen tests, vulnerability scans, and assessments and controls. 
 
-Risks are assessed via MS 365 committees assess new risk by looking at both a quantitative and qualitative 
risk criteria that has been developed by the organization ERM. 
Impact rating criteria which evaluate trust/reputation, operational, legal/compliance/environmental, and 
enterprise value. This is done on a scale of 1-5 with 1 being minimal and 5 being critical. 
For likelihood, this has is assigned a probability rating ranging from >5%-100% and 1-5, 1 being remote 
probability and 5 being an expected probability. 
 
-Control opportunities are assessed which lists general, accountability, investment, metrics and monitoring, 
control validation and financial controls, with a range of 1 being very low to 5 being very high. 
Opportunities to increase the effectiveness of management controls actions and controls are evaluated. 
Taking all 3 values they look at impact x likelihood x control and assign a rating of either severe, high, 
medium, or low. Severe is listed at 100-125, high is 60-99.99, medium is 30-59.9, and low is 1-29.99. Each 
of these is assigned a risk owner, final rank, final score and then the range it falls into. 
 
-Risk treatment plans are developed by the risk committee, whereas the risk option and the owner for the 
risk are identified. The risk owner is assigned the risk treatment plan.

Risk is assigned as a Parent/Child within ADO (mandatory checklist, tracking regarding the risk trends, due 
date), all managed by risk owner. 
 
Reporting Status to management 
Submission of the proposed risk, both annually and bi-annual assessment done as well as the option to add 
or review risk any time through the year outside of these to manage the risk appropriately. All risk is 
elevated to the management committee where it will then go to the ERM Program when necessary. 
 
Monitoring of Ongoing risks 
Tracked in ADO AZUREDevOps as work items, status updates going out regularly on plans and treatments, 
demonstrate competence on the risk management and the drivers of Risk. 
 
Additional Evidence Reviewed: 
-Risk Register (Currently no risk identified as severe) 
-Efficient controls and timelines demonstrated by the organization for the overall risk management

M365 Copilot:  
Planned activities have been fully realized. Methods for determining process results: 
M365 Copilot is an AI-powered assistant integrated into Microsoft 365 to enhance productivity by providing 
intelligent suggestions and automating routine tasks.  
M365 Copilot system flows were tested from Applications as well as UI Chat connections.  These flows 
followed the M365 organization structures for the ISO standards covered in this audit. The Copilot flow 
allows user tokens to move between several different backend services to achieve the desired response to 
the customer inquiry. M365 Copilot can be accessed through an M365 product interface (Word, Excel, 
PowerPoint) using a backend system called Augloop or through a UI chat using a Bizchat Connection.  
Evidence Reviewed: 
-Bizchat Connection – UI chat connection service 
-Augloop Workflow – M365 product connection service 
-Enterprise Sydney – Copilot backend orchestrator 
-3S/LU – Substrate storage and language understanding 
-LLM API – Large Language Model API 
Each Copilot system flow follows the same requirements as all M365 services. M365 Copilot achieved the 
planned results, and the processes are deemed effective.

Hybrid Audit Certification Assessment Program 
 
 
 
 
Expected outcomes for accredited certification. 
What accredited management system certification means? 
To achieve an organization’s objectives related to the Expected Outcomes intended by the management 
systems standard, the accredited management system certification is expected to provide confidence that 
the organization has a management system that conforms to the applicable requirements of the specific 
ISO standard. 
 
bsi.

--- Page 48 ---
 
 
 
Assessment Report. 
 
 
Page 48 of 50 
 
 
 
In particular, it is to be expected that the organization. 
• has a system which is appropriate for its organizational context and certification scope, a defined policy 
appropriate for the intent of the specific management system standard and to the nature, scale and impacts 
of its activities, products and services over their lifecycles, is addressing risks and opportunities associated 
with its context and objectives; 
• analyses and understands customer needs and expectations, as well as the relevant statutory and 
regulatory requirements related to its products, processes and services; 
• ensures that product, process and service characteristics have been specified in order to meet customer 
and applicable statutory/regulatory requirements; 
• has determined and is managing the processes needed to achieve the Expected Outcomes intended by 
the management system standard; 
• has ensured the availability of resources necessary to support the operation and monitoring of these 
products, processes and services; 
• monitors and controls the defined product process and service characteristics; 
• aims to prevent nonconformities, and has systematic improvement processes in place including the 
addressing of complaints from interested parties; 
• has implemented an effective internal audit and management review process; 
• is monitoring, measuring, analyzing, evaluating and improving the effectiveness of its management 
system and has implemented processes for communicating internally, as well as responding to and 
communicating with interested external parties. 
 
What accredited management systems certification does not mean? 
It is important to recognize that management system standards define requirements for an organization’s 
management system, and not the specific performance criteria that are to be achieved (such as product or 
service standards, environmental performance criteria etc.). 
 
Accredited management systems certification should provide confidence in the organization’s ability to meet 
its objectives related to the intent of the management system standard. A management systems audit is 
not a full legal compliance audit and does not necessarily ensure ethical behaviour or that the organization 
will always achieve 100% conformity and legal compliance, though this should of course be a permanent 
goal. 
 
Within its scope of certification, accredited management systems certification does not imply or ensure, for 
example: 
• that the organization is providing a superior product and service, or 
• that the organization’s product and service itself is certified as meeting the requirements of an ISO (or 
any other) standard or specification. 
 
Definitions of findings: 
 
Nonconformity: 
Non-fulfilment of a requirement. 
 
Major nonconformity: 
bsi.

Assessment Report. 
 
 
Page 49 of 50 
 
 
 
Nonconformity that affects the capability of the management system to achieve the intended results. 
Nonconformities could be classified as major in the following circumstances: 
•    If there is a significant doubt that effective process control is in place, or that products or services will 
meet specified requirements; 
•    A number of minor nonconformities associated with the same requirement or issue could demonstrate a 
systemic failure and thus constitute a major nonconformity. 
 
Minor nonconformity: 
Nonconformity that does not affect the capability of the management system to achieve the intended 
results. 
 
Opportunity for improvement: 
It is a statement of fact made by an assessor during an assessment, and substantiated by objective 
evidence, referring to a weakness or potential deficiency in a management system which if not improved 
may lead to nonconformity in the future. We may provide generic information about industrial best 
practices, but no specific solution shall be provided as a part of an opportunity for improvement. 
 
Observation: 
It is ONLY applicable for those schemes which prohibit the certification body to issue an opportunity for 
improvement. 
It is a statement of fact made by the assessor referring to a weakness or potential deficiency in a 
management system which, if not improved, may lead to a nonconformity in the future.
