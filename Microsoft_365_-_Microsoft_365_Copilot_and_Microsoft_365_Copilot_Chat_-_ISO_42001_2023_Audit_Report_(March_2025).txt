Stage 2 Certification Audit Report 
March 20, 2025 
Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft” or the “Client”) completed a management system certification 
assessment with Mastermind Assurance, LLC (“Mastermind”). Mastermind utilized a comprehensive 
approach, incorporating inquiry, inspection, and observation-based methods to evaluate the scope of the 
Client's management system and formulate its audit conclusions. 
1.
Audit Criteria
When meeting the established objectives for this audit, Mastermind assessed the Client’s management 
system for conformity to the following criteria: ISO/IEC 42001:2023 (AI Developer/Provider). 
Through this determination of conformity, Mastermind employed assessment procedures that considered 
the additional requirements governing certification to these standards as described within ISO/IEC 17021-
1:2015, IAF MD 1:2023, and IAF MD 4:2025, as applicable.  
If newer versions of any of these normative references were available at the time of the audit, those revisions 
of the audit criteria were applied unless a transition period had been otherwise defined and assumed by 
the Client. 
2. Audit Objectives
Mastermind has confirmed that the below objectives have been fulfilled:
•
Obtain information and evidence about conformity to all requirements of the applicable
management system standard(s) or other normative documents
•

performance objectives and targets consistent with the expectations in the applicable
management systems standards(s) or other normative documents
•
Determination of the ability of Client’s management system and its performance regarding meeting
of applicable legal or statutory, regulatory, and contractual requirements
•
Evaluate the effectiveness of the management system in achieving the Client’s objectives and

•
Obtain a sufficient understanding of the effective implementation of the management system
•
Confirm that the Client adheres to its own policies, objectives, and procedures
•
Demonstrate that the assessment of related risks is relevant and adequate for the operations within
the management system scope
•
Establish whether the Client’s procedures for the identification, examination, evaluation, and
implementation of related risks are consistent with the policy, objectives, and targets
•
Review changes, if available, to the management system relating to identified Areas of Concern
from the Stage 1 Certification Audit
3. Audit Scope
Mastermind concluded that, in consideration of the identified organizational units justified for inclusion, the 
management system scope remains appropriate, as detailed below. 
The certificate scope comprises the management system supporting the operations of Microsoft 365 
Copilot and Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat offerings. The organizational scope includes the Microsoft 365 
Trusted Platform, Responsible AI, Security, and Privacy teams affecting the management system. These 
activities are governed by the implemented controls that extend to both the AI Developer and AI Provider 
roles in accordance with the organizational Statement of Applicability. 
There were no significant changes affecting the management system scope since the previous audit with 
the exception of further defining the in-scope offerings supported by the AIMS within the scope statement. 
The Stage 2 Certification Audit specifically comprised a review of the management system in the context 
of the activities performed at the central function in addition to a sampling of locations, where eligible and 
if applicable, described below.

8. Audit Findings 
Positive findings (i.e., noteworthy features) relating to the management system are detailed below based 
on observations recorded by the audit team: 
• 
The Microsoft 365 Copilot, pilot program executed with key customers is an excellent example of 
intaking and acting on feedback from interested parties. 
• 
The assignment of Lead Responsible AI (RAI) Champs to features of Microsoft 365 Copilot 
demonstrates maturity of the AIMS and a commitment to RAI. 
• 
The Service Trust Portal (STP) is regularly updated to ensure end users have access to the most 
current compliance deliverables. Access and separation of duty controls for publishing to the STP 
are robust and effective. 
• 
The internal audit function outsourced to EY comprised a team of credentialed technical experts 
and auditors with management system standard audit experience resulting in deep testing and 
thorough reporting.  
• 
The Microsoft 365 Copilot corrective actions process included findings from all sources, including 
self-identified issues. Taking actions on self-identified items reflects significant initial maturity of the 
AIMS and best practice. 
• 
The Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) Abuse portal is an extensively sufficient process for 
reporting concerns related to the Microsoft 365 Copilot and Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat systems. 
• 
Customer feedback mechanisms facilitated by the One Customer Voice (OCV) process represent 
best practices for the intake and triaging of customer feedback. Feedback is captured within an 
M365 Copilot Dashboard with trend analysis for centralized tracking. 
• 
System information assessments (SIA) require additional reviews when AI systems and features 
contain sensitive uses, demonstrating a commitment to taking actions to address risks to 
individuals, groups of individuals, and societies.

Negative findings from these inspections, if identified, were classified as a nonconformity (NC) whenever 
they pertained to the non-fulfillment of a requirement. Nonconformities were rated depending on whether 
the issue restricts (i.e., major) or continues to permit (i.e., minor) the management system to achieve the 
intended results. 
There were no identified nonconformities as a result of the procedures performed affecting the Stage 2 
Certification Audit. 
9. Other Considerations 
The audit team leveraged information and communication technologies (ICT) during this review, including, 
but not limited to, web conferencing software (e.g., Teams) and secure document repositories to enable 
the offline inspection of electronic records provided by the Client. 
Mastermind exercised recognized leading practices for the safeguarding of confidential information 
throughout all planning, scheduled activities, and reporting phases of this assessment. There were no 
unresolved issues at the conclusion of the audit.  
10. Audit Conclusion 
The assessment practices and determinations resulting from this audit were grounded in a sampling 
process limited to the available information, thereby introducing an inherent level of risk to the conclusion. 
The audit team analyzed all information and audit evidence gathered during both the Stage 1 Certification 
Audit and the Stage 2 Certification Audit, including audit findings, to determine its conclusions for initial 
certification. 
From its performance throughout this assessment, the audit team recommends issuance of certification 
for the scope of the management system implemented by the Client. The audit team ascertained sufficient 
conformity and effectiveness of the management system primarily through its examination of electronic 
records, subsequently corroborated through inquiry with the Client. This process supported the conclusion 
that the management system remains capable of meeting the applicable requirements of the audit criteria 
and is positioned to achieve its expected outcomes. Any identified nonconformities will need to be 
corrected prior to a final decision on certification in accordance with agreed upon timelines established 
between the Client and the audit team. 
The Lead Auditor conducted a closing meeting, detailing the audit conclusions and recommendation, with 
the attendance of Client representatives as outlined within Section 6 of this report. There were no unresolved 
points resulting from this communication.
