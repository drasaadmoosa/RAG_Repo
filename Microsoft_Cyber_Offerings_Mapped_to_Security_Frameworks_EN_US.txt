The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is a voluntary Framework 
consisting of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage 
cybersecurity-related risk. The Framework complements an 
organization’s risk management process and cybersecurity program. 
The organization can use its current processes and leverage the 
Framework to identify opportunities to strengthen and communicate its 
management of cybersecurity risk while aligning with industry practices. 
Alternatively, an organization without an existing cybersecurity 
program can use the Framework as a reference to establish one. Just 
as the Framework is not industry-specific, the common taxonomy 
of standards, guidelines, and practices that it provides also is not 
country-specific. Organizations outside the United States may also 
use the Framework to strengthen their own cybersecurity efforts, and 
the Framework can contribute to developing a common language for 
international cooperation on critical infrastructure cybersecurity. 
For this document, we referenced the NIST CSF for Improving Critical 
Infrastructure Cybersecurity version 1.0 from February 2014, Center 
for Internet Security Controls1 and ISO 27001:2013. Note: the two latter 
standards had already been mapped by NIST2. What we provide in this 
document is information and guidance on:
•	 Microsoft Cyber Offerings that can help an organization meet the 
security functions
•	 Certain functions that should be fulfilled by the implementing 
organization utilizing either internal resources or third parties
In the table below, we have included four out of the five NIST CSF Core 
Functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond and Recover) from the 
NIST CSF for which Microsoft Cyber Offerings can help. These offerings 
can help organizations with 70 of the 98 subcategories. Under the 
column “Microsoft Cyber Offerings that Help”, the resources (hyperlinks) 
listed reflect product information and how-to documentation. 
Where no offering is shown, the activity should be covered by the 
implementing organization utilizing internal resources or third parties. 
For Microsoft partners, that white space is the opportunity to step in 
and provide much needed services.

Advanced Threat Analytics, 
there is no need to create rules, 
thresholds, or baselines and 
then fine-tune. ATA analyzes

suspicious activity and known

but Cloud App Security has 
an initial learning period of 
seven days during which not 
all anomaly detection alerts 
are raised. After that, each 
session is compared to the 
activity, when users were active, 
IP addresses, devices, etc. 
detected over the past month 
and the risk score of these 
activities. These detections 
are part of the heuristic 
anomaly detection engine that 
profiles your environment and 
triggers alerts with respect to 
a baseline that was learned on 
your organization’s activity.
With Microsoft Azure Security

statistical profiling to build a
